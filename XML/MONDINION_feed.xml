    <desc>This beautifully preserved Grand 775m2 build, ´Gentleman´s House´ in the old part of Alcaudete, in the Jaén province of Andalucia, Spain, is just crying out to be a B&amp;B or small hotel so its character and history can be seen by all. Well maintained, it´s like a museum. Step off the street through the original double, wooden doors into a tiled vestibule and another double door with the family crest opens into the light and airy hall with open staircase, patio doors and access to the downstairs accommodation. On the right a salon has access on to a room (without light in the video) which was a shop with original counter and doorway to the street (the door on the right of the main door.)  The house had a distillery and some of those features remain. The sitting area has access to a lounge and a kitchen that opens onto the interior patio and has stairs to the first floor.
The main, grand staircase, with stained glass window, leads up to the first floor hallway with a grand dining room with its own kitchen, a large lounge, three bedrooms one of which is en suite. This hallway has access doors to the terrace overlooking the patio and behind closed doors there are more stairs to what would have been the servants quarters. This second floor has four bedrooms, a living room, a bathroom, two big storage areas, a further room and access to the top floor which is unused. It could easily be more than eight bedrooms. The interior patio has a laundry cupboard and access to the distillery with another access onto the street (to the left of the main door) this goes right around the back of the patio and has the original still in place. Through the patio is a shower room and corridor to a large garage area which could be a further patio or with the roof removed has a large enough area for a pool. The roof needs some attention but the plumbing and electrics were renewed about twelve years ago and the majority of the original wooden windows and  doors had double glazing added. A must see if you are searching for a spacious home and business in one with an impressive town plot size of 370m2.</desc>

    <desc>The charming renovations that have been started in this cosy house in Fuensanta de Martos, in the Jaen province of Andalucia need finishing off. The rustic style reclaimed wooden front door leads into a small living area with built in sofa (or bed), large fireplace with a seating area within it and a bread oven.  Through a rustic brick archway is  the kitchen with stairs, access to a laundry area, then a shower room and access to a walled patio.
The stairs lead into 1 bedroom and through into another with further stairs up to the open attic area with great views and access (through a hole) to another room on a lower level which could become a terrace. Lots of thought has been put into this house, it has loads of potential to become a really lovely home on a quiet no through street near the centre of town.</desc>

    <desc>This spectacular property is all about the location! The lake views are amazing and can be enjoyed from every angle of this property whilst only a one-hour drive to Granada or Malaga airports and beaches. The current owners have reformed this property to a very high standard, making this an easy rental, retreat, or a great place to enjoy with your family. There are 5 independent rooms with an ensuite bathroom with a communal kitchen, living space,  terrace, and views. If you see it as a rental you would rent out these 5 rooms and you live upstairs where you have your private retreat with 4 bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen, living space, a private terrace, and again amazing views on the lake. Having then across the street again 3 other separate apartments with ensuite bathroom and private kitchen your rental income will be high. You could rent this out to bigger families who want to have more privacy. If you say I just want to have a big house with views of the lake, undisturbed views with peace you will find here!!! The current owners sell it as a business but can be bought also as a private retreat. The business comes with a plot of  24,400m2 of land that consists of olive threes which at moment the owner collects his part of the fresh hand olive oil but you could make an agreement with the farmer to get money out of this. Together then with the rental business and potential side business like there is a boat with license, some kayaks you could rent out and arrange boat trips or if you have clients who do not like the water there is the road around the lake as you can rent out a Vespa to enjoy the surroundings and lake. Further, we have a large pool, mini-golf area, private parking space, riding your horse between the olive trees is possible as you also have a stable for your horse. This is an amazing opportunity to purchase a stunning home with the opportunity of an income should you require it. Finished throughout to an extremely high standard this property really must be seen to be appreciated!</desc>

    <desc>This large house with parking outside and plenty of accommodation is just waiting for a new owner to put their signature on it. Enter the large wooden front doors into a vestibule with a room, at present 1 bedroom, on the right and the living room on the left. Straight ahead there is another open area with stairs on the left and another big bedroom. Straight ahead goes outside and on left is a good sized kitchen. The outside space is pretty exceptional for a town house with access from the other street. A car could be parked there or build a garage and still leave room for a spacious patio. Back in the house the first floor has a large landing with a further 4 bedrooms. Also there are stairs leading to the attic where there are rooms for storage. This would make a great family house or Bed and Breakfast with the added bonus of parking and being near the old part of town.</desc>

The highlights during the summer season are the large swimming pool and the partially covered terrace, which is ideal for "al fresco" meals and to enjoy the balmy evenings. The house offers a lot of privacy and its corner location and generous 505m2 plot is definitely a plus. The property is very close to the countryside and the town of Dilar and its mountains, part of the Sierra Nevada protected area, being very close to the town center. This house is surrounded by a healthy environment. The water is the same as that of Lanjarón and it is possible to taste it in the different sources and springs of Dilar; In addition, La Inmaculada hospital is very close and well connected. Difficult to find a place with such healthy conditions, so well connected and close to a ski resort and the beach at the same time. The property has its own water tank, which makes its supply optimal and economical. Satellite Internet coverage is very efficient, due to its proximity to the Sierra Nevada repeater. This house is being sold fully furnished and is therefore ready to move into. This property is perfect for those looking for a place that combines the best of both worlds, nature and tranquility on the one hand with comfort and modern conveniences on the other.</desc>

    <desc>This Beautifully presented 3 bedroom Villa is walled and gated and has a large private driveway leading to a carport (with roof terrace) with private parking for up to 4 cars. There are patio and garden areas both shaded and open along with terraces from which to enjoy the Spanish sunshine and dramatic views over the wonderful Andalucian countryside and mountains.
The heated pool is 8x4m and has lovely seating areas around it including a featured BBQ area for alfresco dining on the large granite dining table. There is a large storeroom attached to the house, and another newly built storeroom, next to the walk in pump house for the pool. These rooms and the carport have water and electricity plumbed in and could be converted into further accommodation subject to permissions. There are external garden lights and external all weather sockets.
There are two entrances to the house from the front terrace; one into the lounge and one into the kitchen. The kitchen is charming, with granite worktops and a mix of modern appliances along with Moorish and Andalusian features. The lounge is cozy and has a modern shower room off it with a marble sink. There is also  a double bedroom next to the lounge and it could be used as  a reception/dining room.
On the second floor there is a landing currently used as an office area with two further bedrooms one of which is a double. There is good internet connection providing excellent computer, TV and radio reception.
The storeroom houses a modern Bio Mass Burner to provide central heating to the house which runs very cheaply using a side product from the olive crops. The same burner heats the pool in Spring and Autumn. The fuel supplier is in the village and delivers free of charge. There is also a water filtration system in this room.
Hot and cold air conditioning is fitted throughout and the windows are double glazed with fly screens and  security shutters. The security of windows and doors is further enhanced with traditional metal bars (rejas) that have locks with the keys accessible from inside the house providing escape routes in the case of fire. This is a great house for either full time living or a holiday home. It’s in a fantastic country location, on the edge of a small village  with masses of great usable outside space, close to the larger towns of Alcala la Real and Alcaudete. Granada (and its airport) is about an hour away, as is Cordoba. Malaga Airport is two hours by car with good road connections to the motorway.</desc>

    <desc>Walnut Farm sits just a 10 minute drive from historical Antequera and only a 40 minute drive to Malaga with great access to the Autovia. The property is accessed by a new tarmac road and private gated entrance. Once inside there are two completely separate properties both offering charm and character throughout with beamed ceilings and open fireplaces, good size kitchens with plenty of storage space and both with 2 double bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The properties sit within a generous 2,485m2 plot and are surrounded by lush established gardens which have been lovingly landscaped with plenty of mature olive trees and walnut trees creating areas to sit and relax, prepare food on the BBQ and dine alfresco, places to play games with the children, including a badminton court, giant chess board, adventure play area and of course an amazing heated pool surrounded by a beautiful patio area to sit and soak up that Andalucian sunshine with a cool tinto verano from the private bar. The two properties are totally independent so would be great for anyone who has constant family visitors or if someone would like to make a little extra income. To appreciate this property it really needs to be seen, stunning views from all around, with mains electric and water from the 3 wells.</desc>

    <desc>Exclusive to us. This large 227m2 build 4 bedroom house in the centre of Santiago de Calatrava, in the province of Jaen, Andalucia, Spain just needs a bit of modernization to make a great family home with lots of outside space. Enter the double wooden front doors into an Andalucian tiled vestibule, through which is a short hall and a nice open plan dining or sitting area. To the left is a lounge and on the right a large ground floor bedroom. From the dining area with a staircase and wood burner there is a large kitchen with a sitting or dining area and access to a utility area and shower room. Outside, the patio has a well (and a pump) and access to an older bathroom through which is a workshop or store room. Walled off from the patio is another area with two covered corners and a square vegetable plot which adds up to plenty of space to put a pool. Upstairs there is a shower room, a large landing and two large bedrooms and a smaller bedroom but still decent size. A great centrally located town house with good outside spaces within the generous 285m2 town plot which would be ideal for Bed and Breakfast especially as there is a large wedding venue, with no accommodation, ten minutes away. There is the possibility of purchasing separately a large garage nearby.</desc>

    <desc>This Lovely Cortijo on the outskirts of Fuente Del Conde sits on a plot of 1108m2 and a build of 145m2. The previous owners transformed this old Cortijo to a nice holiday home. They added a good sized pool with private walls and there are no neighbors above. So, you can sit relaxed and tranquil. The property comes as an off-grid property. You have a solar panel installation with batteries that supply you through the winter and summer with enough power. You have a woodstove and the next-door farmer can supply all the wood. The water is a 15.000 litre deposit that the same farmer fills up for you from his well. There is also a well on your terrain. So, you have 2 water sources. The town of Fuente del Conde is a 5min drive  where you have a little supermarket and a bar. Iznajar is a 15 min drive and here you will find all amenities. Outside the property, you have a large terrace with amazing views over the mountains of Fuente del Conde and Iznajar, where you can swim and do all kinds of watersports. Inside, you have a living space with a fitted kitchen. On the first floor, you have 2 double bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. 1 bathroom is en-suite. This Cortijo is always the same temperature as it has incredibly thick walls. So in ''winter'', it is easy to control your temperature inside. In summers there is no need for an air conditioning unit. This ideal lovely Cortijo is for people who want to relax, safe, off-grid, with nice views but still close to a town and Iznajar Lake which is a really good alternative for the beach.</desc>

    <desc>This is a fantastic opportunity for anyone looking to enjoy the Spanish countryside and way of life whilst still having good access to the beautiful town of Antequera and all it has to offer, including amazing health facilities, schools, large supermarkets, shops, bars and restaurants. The main property is a single storey with a gated entrance which leads in to a private courtyard with grapevines for shade. Once inside there is a good sized living area, a spacious country kitchen with plenty of storage, a large full family bathroom and four good sized bedrooms. Although the property is being sold with over 29000m2 of land most of it is not fenced as it's made of mainly of mature olive trees. The area around the property has been fenced making this completely private with fruit trees and plenty of room for a vegetable garden. The land reaches down to the road and continues on the other side where there is a second casita (cottage) which is also included; this is small but could be used for guests. Great Rural property amazing views, plenty of potential.</desc>

    <desc>This is a unique opportunity to purchase a rustic property which retains many traditional features whilst being within walking distance of the popular town of Mollina in the Malaga province of Andalucia, Spain and all its shops, bars and restaurants.  The property offers immense potential for modernisation with space for 3 double bedrooms and bathroom(s) upstairs.  This would create a superb living/dining area downstairs with potential for a 4th bedroom. The traditional style kitchen might need a bit of imagination although there is already a newly installed shower room downstairs. The wonderfully-spacious walled patio area outside would provide plenty of room for a pool and car-parking, as well as outside living.  This would be an amazing property for someone who wants privacy within easy reach of local amenities and the historical town of Antequera.</desc>

    <desc>Located in the province of Cordoba in the hamlet of Venta Valero, these two Cortijos are looking for their new owner to reform and bring back the charm.  
On the market for less than 40,000 euros this really is a true bargain.  The main Cortijo is semi-detached but private as the neighbour is behind.  You have a patio to the front covered with grapevines to give you that much needed shade in the summer months.  From here we walk directly into the kitchen come dining room.  To the right we find a downstairs bedroom but would be much better making a living room and to the back where we have the stairs there is a room perfect to use as a store room.  Going up the stairs we turn to the left and come across a bathroom, you will see that the roof in here does need some looking at, a good clean and TLC.  To the right of the stairs which is the front of the Cortijo we have two good sized rooms, both being used as bedrooms, typical Spanish style one walking into another.  Again here you will see that part of the roof needs some work.  This particular property has a private garage attached to the back with separate access.  The second Cortijo located across the lane is just being used as storage, with again a patio area to the front you also have two small outbuildings either to knock down or reform.  The downstairs is simply two rooms, both with individual doors one of which has a large open fireplace.  The upstairs is one big open space with its access behind the property.  This could easily be knocked around and made into one making a small rental property.  The Cortijos once had mains electric and water, there is also well water.  If your looking for a very quiet location but only a 18 minute drive from a major town then this investment is just for you!! Do not hesitate to book your viewing appointment today!!</desc>

    <desc>This lovely 3 bedroom townhouse is centrally located in the pretty town of Gilena which sits in the province of Seville, just a short  drive from from historical Estepa. The property has a typical Andalucian tiled entrance hall which leads to a central sitting room, 1 ground floor bedroom and a separate dining room that opens to the kitchen. The dining room has doors that open to a small courtyard with a utility room and bathroom. On the first floor there is 1 large master bedroom at the front of the property and a small storage room or study. In the centre, the hall continues to a 2nd large bedroom to the rear that opens onto a covered roof terrace. On the second floor is an attic space, which could be easily converted into more living space. This is a great property that needs some modernising, but would make a lovely home.</desc>

    <desc>This large family Villa on the outskirts of Monturque within walking distance to amenities is  really good value for money ! Outside you have several buildings where a lot of ideas are possible and you have extensive level land totalling more than 11,600m2. You can use it as a big professional tool shop, parking cars, mobile homes, stables for horses, or any other idea you may have. The vendor told me he could get licenses from the town hall to transform this into apartments but maybe a camping spot is a possibility as you have lots of outdoor space including an outbuilding that can be used as a communal shower block. The swimming pool is presented attached to an outdoor kitchen and barbecue area as well as a bathroom. The water is connected to the river as well as mains water. Once inside you have a living space, kitchen,1 bedroom downstairs, and a bathroom. Going upstairs you have 3 other good size bedrooms with a bathroom and the master bedroom with views over the garden , field and river and has an en-suite bathroom. The house is built with qualified material. This is an ideal family home for somebody who likes a lot of outdoor space and wishes to attach a business to his or her home.</desc>

    <desc>With vision this town house has been transformed and now needs someone to finish it off. Enter the front door and daylight from a skylight fills the open plan dining area, kitchen, utility area, shower room and lounge. Go up the stairs opposite the front door onto a large landing area off which is the door to the roof terrace with garden access, a good sized bedroom and further stairs leading to another large bedroom. Outside the terrace leads up to the garden with an orange tree and fabulous views over the roof tops and town to the mountains beyond. With all new plumbing, electrics and windows this is a lovely home and quite rare having a garden, with great views, as well as a terrace. The kitchen units are there but do need fitting.</desc>

    <desc>This is a rare opportunity to let your creative side excel. Yes it needs renovating but this is were the creativity starts. If you plan on living here there are grants available to help with the restoration. They were two houses, one at the front (liveable in) and one at the back (needs more work) they are now interconnected.
Enter the front door off the main old plaza into the front room which was once a shop. There is a room further back and the stairs off to the left that go up to the first floor. Off to the right is a fitted kitchen  separated by a partition wall from a utility room. These could easily be knocked into one. From there there are some steps leading up to a long room which was part of the other bigger house at the back. This was once a bakery with the bakers oven still in place.
Back at the front house from the stairs there is the first floor room with its balcony accessed via twin double doors and views across the main square and Martos Hill above. Further stairs lead to a bathroom and then two bedrooms and a roof terrace. The older, bigger house at the back has some lovely original features. This property just cries out to be brought back to life and enjoyed to the full. Watch the video to  put it into perspective.</desc>

    <desc>This is one of those rare investment opportunities that could be used for off grid living although electricity could be reconnected, it has a spring water supply. Access to the semi-detached cortijo is via a  well maintained tarmac lane which is connected to a rougher track for a short distance to reach the road to Fuensanta de Martos. Enter through the large double wooden south facing front door into a corridor with a room on the left and the kitchen on the right. Further on there is another room on the left and another on the right and also straight ahead there is a cupboard that goes under the stairs. From the kitchen you can go into the garage which has a stable at the back. Further on there is another door to the outside which was a pigsty. Back in the house the wide easy going staircase takes you up to the first floor where there are three more rooms, one of which is very large. There is no bathroom at the moment but plenty of scope for several. The house is about 60m2 plot size not including the pigsty. Behind the house there are 25 mature olive trees and about 1Km away another 35 trees. Below the house at a distance of about 100m there is a piece of flat land (5000m2 approx) for growing veggies and has its own water supplied from an irrigation canal on which a very low yearly maintenance fee is charged.</desc>

The inviting pool sits right by the left of the chalet itself, surrounded both by a big established fruit tree orchard and a sun terrace with a barbecue area that can be accessed directly from the master bedroom or the conservatory. As you enter the house through the conservatory itself, you are welcomed by a good size lounge diner with an open fireplace on the left and a modern fully fitted kitchen on the right. Past the kitchen, a doorway leads to a hall with access to the two double bedrooms, the master being en suite, a walk in pantry and the main bathroom are located. The property boasts lots of personality and some good and interesting furniture pieces. It is also equipped with air conditioning and a video camera system for security, though the area is already safe. A property you certainly won't want to miss if you are looking for a comfortable easy living, one level, quality lifestyle with a generous 2,172m2 plot in sunny southern Spain.</desc>

    <desc>A 3 bedroom Townhouse with a good sized private garden in a town centre location to totally reform and build is now on the market for only 16.000,00 Euros. Close to all the amenities it is difficult to find properties in the centre of town with such outside spaces. When this property has been reformed it will retain a good value because of its situation and garden areas. The distribution and proportion of the rooms are of a good size so you can design your own interior and make great use of the private external space where you can enjoy the warm sunshine of southern Spain and the laid back friendly lifestyle of inland Andalucia. Situated in the village of Ventas Del Carrizal, nestling at the foot of the San Pedro mountain range, between the large towns of Alcala la Real and Alcaudete it is a great base for such outdoor activities as cycling, hiking and mountain biking. This property offers a great investment opportunity or ground level entry in to the Spanish Property Market.</desc>

    <desc>Situated in the lively city of Martos in the Jaen province of Andalucia this is a well maintained, very pleasant 3 bedroom terrace house, although in need of some modernization but this is reflected in the price. Just a few touches here and there and you have yourself a easy to maintain holiday or permanent home. From the street up some steps you enter through the front door into  a sitting room with stairs to the right. Then straight ahead some steps into the dining room with the kitchenette on the right. Ahead there are steps up and through a doorway to the small utility area where the washing machine is and then further on is the bathroom. To the left is the access to a lower patio which at the far end has steps up to a terrace over the bathroom.
Upstairs and to the left is the main bedroom and ahead another bedroom leading into another room which is used for storage but could be converted into a bedroom or bathroom. The house has air conditioning in various rooms.</desc>

    <desc>If you like puzzles this one is for you. An enormous town house with a separate flat within it on the second floor that is not included. The property has a shared entrance door with an antique tiled lobby and hallway with a lovely old staircase, also shared. Enter the door under the stairs to five rooms plus a bathroom and kitchen with access steps down to a walled patio. From the patio is access to an enormous basement with a metal door to the street. These five large rooms, most with windows, could make one large apartment. The second floor is owned by others. The top floor has an access door to a store room owned by the third party and then three good sized rooms with a beautiful old tiled corridor overlooking the church with an access door up to storage under the new roof. With some lovely features the video does not do it justice. Fancy a value adding project ? This could be the one.</desc>

    <desc>This town house on the outskirts of Fuensanta de Martos, almost on top of a hill and has some far reaching dramatic countryside and mountain views and could become an equally lovely dwelling. Open the front door into a typical Spanish kitchen with a fireplace and window with a view. Through here on the left is the stair access and the bathroom, on the right is a door with access to the garage, which could be converted into a dining room or lounge. Upstairs is 1 large bedroom (which could have an en suite) and a good sized roof terrace. Down stairs, accessed by an external door are lots of storage rooms, currently animal pens, for further living accommodation and a nice private garden with those special views. Lots of scope to reform as desired. TH4629 is for sale from the same owner and TH4241 are both just across the street for a secondary dwelling or granny flat.</desc>

    <desc>This is a great solid town house waiting for some new owners and some attention. It is ready to live in but in need of modernization in the old but  level part of the town. Nice easy stairs lead up to  two bedrooms, one with en suite and a third if you count the large walk through landing.  Further stairs lead up to the beamed attic which could make another room or two. Downstairs you step into a living room then into another sitting area or dining room, walk through the galley kitchen into an Andalucian tiled patio then through another door is a laundry room, a bathroom and a workshop with an open fireplace. Outside there is a steep garden reaching up to a wall through which access could be made for parking or a garage.</desc>

    <desc>This property is ready to move into, it just needs the furniture. New wiring and plumbing is already done and the walls finished minus the painting. Yes the property is small but is a perfect bolt hole or first property for anyone thinking of moving to or having a holiday home in Spain. There is parking nearby and from there you go down a street to get to the house. The sturdy looking metal front door gives you access to the living room with its fireplace and stone clad walls. At the other end of this room are the stairs to the first floor which has two connected bedrooms and a bathroom with access to an open room or gazebo where you get those lovely views. On the ground floor beyond the stairs is the kitchen area and in the corner the washing machine. The electricity and water are not connected at the moment but are ready to go. A little charmer.</desc>

    <desc>EXCLUSIVE to us.This large 204m2 build Renovation Project includes a total of 5 or more bedrooms within 2 Townhouses both with a Garden and is situated in popular Castillo de Locubin just a short drive to the historical city of Alcala la Real in the Jaen province of Andalucia. These substantial properties, with a generous total town plot size of 238m2, have separate entrances both from a safe raised pedestrian pavement. You have the opportunity to create one very large family residence or keep them as two townhouses each with their own garden. On the market for 56.000,00 euros you get a lot of property and outside space for the money. This is one to view with an Architect if you are not an experienced renovator or builder because the potential is enormous. The main property has many charming features which could be kept as part of any renovation plans and there is plenty of outside space to add a swimming pool or two. Neighbouring properties have all been renovated to a good standard which will help realise any plan to market the properties once updated. This property we believe has great upside potential, why not employ your own Architect or Surveyor to give you their expert independent advice on the project.</desc>

    <desc>Situated in the Spanish village of Fuente Tojar and close to the large town of Priego de Cordoba this 3 bed townhouse.
Offering lots of character and potential this property has lots of hidden gems which with a little bit of uncovering could make this place stunning like stripping back the old original beams to show the natural wood and also bring back the traditional doors to their former glory.   The ground floor offers a lounge area, kitchen come diner, utility and family bathroom, by knocking down some outbuildings the two small patio areas would make one large one giving you great outside space which gets the sun all day long.
The first floor offers 3 double bedrooms, and other rooms which could be converted into extra bathrooms or living space.  You then have the attic which is huge and a blank canvas.  This place really does have plenty of potential.</desc>

    <desc>A great Investment opportunity to acquire two townhouses in the traditional Spanish village of Fuente Tojar close to the popular town
of Priego de Cordoba in Andalucia. The first property has a open plan kitchen lounge with access to a private terrace with views over the village to the mountains beyond and a full shower room plus a double bedroom. The second Townhouse is in need of reform  but is situated on a lovely Spanish square and would make and great 3 bedroom property with some outside space.

    <desc>I hear you say what only 19,000 euros?  Yes that is correct, you can get yourself a 3 bed townhouse located in the pretty village of La Concepcion for this price.  The unique feature to this property is the entrance with its gates and front patio covered by grape vines giving plenty of shade in the summer months. You have a bathroom, small kitchen, space for a living room and separate diner along with 3 good sized bedrooms and potential to add a second bathroom on the first floor.  There is a great sized courtyard to the back which at the moment has been taken over by a large fig tree but once cleared out would make a fantastic private sun patio. With some imagination and renovation  this townhouse could be lovely for a holiday lock up and go or even long term home.  There is electric to the house but will need re-connecting.

    <desc>5 Bedroom 2 bathroom town house with massive potential. Some modernization is needed at the back of the house to bring it up to date, but if you´re looking for outdoor space this is the house for you, it has a patio and a garden with space for a swimming pool. Entering the house we have a short hallway leading to a large lounge that opens up to the patio, next to the lounge there is a large bedroom area with a window to the street. 
Moving out of the lounge there is a dining area that leads to the kitchen both with windows that open towards the patio. Outside is a large patio that leads to the garden, before that is a room with a chimney and sink that could be converted into a bar or barbecue area, there's also another area that needs renovating that could be easily converted into a guest house with en suite, or just storage. Upstairs there are 3 bedrooms and a bathroom and a room perfect for a closet or small bathroom, a great large house needing updating to your taste.</desc>

    <desc>There are buildings that for a long time were a necessary and indispensable material part of the livelihood, happiness and prosperity of many families and nowadays they resist the inclemency of the weather and the neglect of their owners and for different reasons they need to be sold. This is the case of this old Cortijo located in the centre of several plots of land full of olive trees in the municipality of Lucena in the province of Cordoba. This property consists of 4 plots totalling 99.065 square metres with a total of 693 productive dry land olive trees, but with a well and all have the respective subsidy. It should be clarified that it is a single cortijo with two owners and it is not the Cortijo that is being sold but the plots with the olive trees. The cortijo is an added value to the sale, it is "a treasure" in the countryside with a lot of potential and as the crow flies you could say that it has more than 600 square metres built, where it would be very easy to get the Licence of first occupation, because the documents are in order and the law would favour the future owners a lot even if they wanted to buy the other part of the cortijo, see reference CJ682, which would add 67.929 square metres for a total of 166.924m2 and would increase the amount of olive trees and therefore the benefits. The property is 3.5km from Benamejí, well known throughout Spain for its baseball stadium and where you will get all the services you need for peaceful living and is only 5km from the A-45 motorway linking the cities of Cordoba and Malaga. If you are a person who loves to live in the countryside, quiet and with a spectacular 360 degree view all around, do not hesitate to visit this property.

    <desc>This spectacular large estate is located in the municipality of Cambil, Jaen province. Situated 19km from Jaen city, 67km from Granada and 180km from Malaga. The main gate is accessed via a tarmac road from the  A44 Granada - Madrid dual carriage way (autovia). The estate has a lot to offer in regards to its flora and fauna and facilities. For example the vegetation on the estate is considerably varied having almost all the typical plant species found in Sierra Magina Natural Park. Thus we find areas of holm oaks which produce quantities of acorns that feed the large and small fauna. Also there are areas of junipers, savin junipers, cornicabras and broom where the animals can find rest and much needed shade. The site has large woodland areas of pine trees that couild be used for the production of timber. There are 400 olive trees on this plot most of which are presently used as feed for cattle. However they could be developed for the production of olive oil having the prestigious D.O. qualification.
The estate consists of land that has the following makeup , 245 Hectares Mountainous, 250 Hectares Pasteur, 70 Hectares Woodland, 40 Hectares Arable, 12 Hectares Olive grove. The fauna found on the estate are wild boar, deer, mouflon, spanish goat, turtle dove, thrush, wood pigeon, rabbit. dove and red legged partridge. Roe deer are not present at the moment but it's introduction has been requested because of the benefits for the estate. There are 18 water troughs dotted around the estate and these are supplied by water from the 3 strategically placed water storage tanks. There are 2 wells, 4 small reservoirs that fill up with rain water and a spring plus there is town water from Cambil just in case.
There are three properties on the estate, the main one which is 80 percent finished and is more or less in the middle of the vast estate and in an elevated position. It has four bedrooms and two bathrooms an enormous sitting room or banqueting hall and a kitchen diner with pantry. There is a large workshop with a flat above that consists of three bedrooms two bathrooms, kitchen and lounge with fireplace. The third property is the guard´s house and that has three bedrooms, one bathroom and a kitchen diner. This is being used at the moment. 
Now we come to facilities where there are stables, barns, corals and chicken runs. There are also about 30 feeding troughs dotted the property. The workshop as mentioned before with the flat above is well equipped for carrying out any necessary repairs to estate vehicles. Its area is approximately 300m2. It also has quite a large fireplace for those chilly days on the farm. The stables are at the back and suitable for up to five horses. On the same property is the chicken run of about 100m2.

    <desc>Situated in popular La Carrasca in the Jaen province of Andalucia.Take off the animal barn roofs to make a roof terrace for cool breezes and far reaching olive grove and mountain views. This village house on a sloping street, not far from a bar or the reservoir of Las Casillas, just needs some finishing off. With a good roof and mains water and electricity connected it´s ready to be lived in while being updated. Step off the stone cladding pavement into the lounge off which is a dining room or downstairs bedroom, the galley kitchen and the stairs. Go through the nice fitted kitchen into the patio area complete with washing sink, bathroom and raised animal pens. The stairs rise into the front bedroom, off which is a second double bedroom with those great views out the back. A great little property to live in or lock up and leave.</desc>

La Guijarrosa is a 10-minute drive from the town of La Carlota, which is next to the motorway that connects the famous Andalucian cities of Córdoba and Seville, with Seville airport being a one-hour drive from the villa. La Carlota has a large Mercadona and Día supermarkets and all the shops and bars you could wish for.  Ecija is a 20-minute drive in the opposite direction and is a very large town. This property has two entrances from two different streets. Accessing the property through the main entrance you will find the villa surrounded by a beautifully manicured mature garden with fruit trees*, a separately fenced animal area with a brick-built dog kennel, and a large, tiled swimming pool, 10m X 5m plus the roman end steps. The Chalet has a porch that leads to a large living room with a fireplace and log burner. From the living room you will find a corridor from which you access a full shower room and WC, three large bedrooms, one of which is currently used as an office, and the fully fitted kitchen. 
The main bedroom has an en suite bathroom with Jacuzzi bath. The bright and spacious, fully equipped kitchen has a log burner installed in a fireplace and a double oven. The chalet is UPVC double glazed in all rooms except the kitchen. There is a door that leads out to the garden.

One is used as storage with a small workshop, and the other in which the garden tools and wood for the log burners are stored. The living room, kitchen and bedrooms all have air conditioners that blow cold and warm air. This is a great opportunity to live in a quiet and friendly village near big cities.

    <desc>The town of El Borge is located at the foot of Mount Cerro de Cútar and is known as the "capital of raisins" because it is one of the largest producers of muscat raisins. So it comes as no surprise that El Borge is one of the towns on the Ruta de la Pasa and that you can see many raisins in the area. Just on the outskirts of this town we find this beautiful holiday complex that has four spacious homes and a main Living accommodation. Each house is beautifully furnished with a living / dining room, open kitchen, a double bedroom and a bathroom with a shower. The houses vary in size, but all have air conditioning in the living rooms, almost all with a wood stove and electric heating in the bedrooms and bathrooms. The properties have retained their charm with wooden beamed ceilings that provide a warm and rustic atmosphere. There is a beautiful terrace in front of each house where you can sit and relax. The main building has a large kitchen diner and a very spacious living room, with a wood stove and air conditioning, a double bedroom with a whole wall of fitted wardrobes and a private bathroom with a bathtub. At the front there is a large south-facing terrace with a shaded seating area. Below this terrace there is a huge private storage room perfect for bed linen and towels. The washing machine is also located below. In addition the property has solar panels that provide hot water, a 125,000 liter water tank and a 3 x 6 m pool with sun loungers and a beautifully landscaped garden with mature fruit tress and children's play area. This complex on a generous 5,500m2 plot is less than 2 km from the village and can be easily reached on foot. In the village you will find restaurants, bars, shops, a doctor and a community sports complex with a large swimming pool and tennis court.</desc>

    <desc>Just the perfect property for those looking for peace and quiet surrounded by the nicest views around. It is a cute little cortijo of 43m2, but with room to expand, at present you have a kitchen diner where there is an open fireplace and a double bedroom with en suite shower room. Behind this main building there is large room that could be converted into more living accommodation as well as the opportunity to build other rooms above, so basically, the house could be extended. Around the property there is 5000m2 of land where there are different fruit trees, gardens, parking area, a patio and a swimming pool, wherever you are, the scenery leaves you speechless. This property works with solar panels and well water, so there are no utility bills to pay making for a very economical lifestyle. It is ready to move into but for sure you could add your personal touch to finish this dream property. The track leading up to this spectacular location is in parts more suited to 4 x 4 vehicles but we can help you with costings to improve those areas to make for easier access to this ideal retreat.</desc>

    <desc>A truly delightful Andalusian farmhouse dating from the 19th Century with a current floor area exceeding 200m2.   It is full of character and occupies a wonderful location between Alora and El Chorro, and just a short drive to the Caminito del Rey.  The property also has a separate high quality 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom single storey dwelling of 110m2 with a large open plan living space ideal for holiday letting or extended family.  This was built with a full project and all the construction is included in the Certificate of Primary Occupation.  This is also registered with the Junta Andalucia as tourist accommodation having been inspected and given registration VTAR01267. The property is accessed through high metal gates, giving both privacy and security and the areas immediately around the house are paved or gravel to provide ample parking and for ease of maintenance.  From a raised covered terrace, which has amazing views across the valley, the front door opens into a hall and snug area with a cosy reading corner.  From here through an opening that was originally the front door,  the building opens into the main sitting room with ceiling beams, original open fireplace and high Jotul eco wood burner and over mantle.  This room opens on to a dining room and a good sized fully fitted kitchen and an adjoining large utility room.
From the kitchen the back door opens into an enclosed gated courtyard.  From here there is access to a large room with arched doors and en suite shower room.  This lovely space with an aircon / heating unit can be used as an alternative reception room or large bedroom.
The stairs in the main sitting room lead up to the master suite with a large bedroom, dressing room, en suite shower room and two balconies.  On this floor there is also a double bedroom with beamed ceiling and en suite shower room.  This can also be accessed directly from stairs up from the courtyard.  Both bedrooms have aircon / heating units. The second property, built in 2004/5 has spacious accommodation throughout.  The large master bedroom has an en suite bathroom, and the twin bedroom has a wet room adjacent.  The open plan, vaulted and beamed living space of approximately 50m2 has a large Hergom wood burner that provides vented heating to both bedrooms and bathrooms. The kitchen is traditional Andalusian in style and fitted with a full oven, dishwasher etc. To the rear of this property there is a long covered area, part of which is set up to be an outside kitchen with water and power, but is currently used for a table tennis table.  Directly behind the master bedroom is a large covered storage area (approx 14m x 4m). The spacious Cortijo complex comes with a very generous plot of 36,500m2 of wonderful Andalucian countryside.</desc>

    <desc>Where to start! This is probably one of the most beautiful townhouses in Alora. Built in the 1920s in the most sought after street in town, it has been lovingly refurbished and is a perfect example of what sympathetic re-modelling can achieve. Everything about the house shouts quality and there is still so much flexibility in the layout. As with all grand Townhouses you enter from the street into a tiled vestibule and then into the entrance hall. A door from here gives access to the single car garage.  Double French doors lead into an inner sitting room with French doors out onto the wonderful ground floor patio and through to the fully fitted kitchen, one beautiful bedroom, also with patio access and an en-suite bathroom. Also, from this area is a second access to the garage and a useful storage room. A marble staircase leads to the first floor with a stunning living room which stretches across the front of the property with Juliette balconies overlooking the street. A fully fitted and equipped second kitchen with a beautiful dining area which has access to a breakfast terrace with views to the hills. Two further bedrooms, one with an en-suite bathroom and dressing room and an office/study complete this level. Stairs then lead up to the third floor with a central hall and 3 more bedrooms, a bathroom with corner bath and access to the top terrace with great views across the countryside. Outside the splendid patio is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the peace of the evening. External stairs from this area link to the other two patio areas on the higher levels. Should you wish to consider dividing the property into separate apartments, these external stairways would offer an easy solution. All mains services are connected and there is an additional small garage space to the side of the property. All of the town's many amenities are within a few minutes walk of the house and we have an excellent train link to Málaga and the airport for added convenience. Don't hesitate to request a viewing for this wonderful, majestic home.</desc>

    <desc>An absolutely charming village house that has been extensively modernised in the last few years to offer excellent 2 bedroom accommodation. You enter at street level, with the two bedrooms at the front and the well equipped kitchen/living area and shower room to the rear. The house has a great roof terrace with stunning views of the castle and mountains and, should you need additional living space, it would be possible to build a second level here, with a new roof terrace on top! The house also has extensive areas below the main living quarters, with two rooms and a small garden area. It may also be possible to put steps down to the rear to a parking area, which would be a big bonus.</desc>

    <desc>This corner town house which is presently lived in is in a great location in Alcaudete, in the Jaen province of Andalucia, Spain, located behind the convent with views of its vegetable garden and the castle and the mountains beyond. There is small car access but no passing traffic, a really delightful spot just two minutes walk from the main old plaza and bars. The roof was replaced several years ago and most of the electrics are new and embedded with one or two rooms still with surface mounted cables. There is a side door into a covered patio with bathroom and kitchen access, this could become a garage if wanted. The front door, around the corner, enters into a hallway with two rooms off, both used as temporary bedrooms at present at the end of the hall the stairs are on the right and the kitchen to the left. The stairs go up to a hallway off which are three separate bedrooms and up more stairs there is an attic or store room and access to the roof terrace with those great views. This is a delightful ready to go property, nothing to do but a bit of modernisation in a quiet part of a lovely town.</desc>

    <desc>This was the ´Big´house in town with a grand facade and some beautiful original features such as the tiled entrance and staircase. At present the two upper floors are empty shells to be transformed as required, making 3, 4 or maybe 5 bedrooms with en suites. The downstairs has a front parlour, a sitting room, a ´kitchen´and a hallway from which the ornate staircase rises. Overlooking the main plaza this would make a gorgeous B&amp;B something the town does not have. An original fireplace and pantry with ornate wrought iron grill lead out to a great spacious plot with access onto the street at the back. There could be a pool, garden or patio and parking area here.
For someone with vision this is a great sound property with a new roof that needs life breathed into it and to become grand once again.</desc>

The house is currently divided into two apartments with separate entrances, but could easily go back to being single home. However, as it is, it offers good rental options for one of the apartments while you live in the other. In apartment 1, a small staircase leads up to a lounge with a Julliette balcony with a wonderful view. There are 3 bedrooms, of which two are double rooms, leading from the lounge. Through the kitchen you come out to a laundry room which in turn leads out to a full bathroom.
In apartment 2 you enter directly from the ground floor into a lounge area, to the left you will find a bedroom. From the lounge you enter an inner hall, with a second large bedroom and to the left a TV room. Via the TV room you enter the kitchen which has a useful large pantry.
Through the hall you come to a covered patio, here you will find a new bathroom and a storage room. You then come out into a small patio where a staircase leads up to a large terrace with a beautiful view across the rooftops to the mountains.
The whole house is in very good condition having been newly decorated.</desc>

    <desc>A few meters from the thermal spa of Carratraca, and supplied by the same waters, we find this property. You already fall in love from the outside for its orange trees, its fig trees, its olive trees and a white house, maybe not too big but well equipped with a patio and wide possibilities of use and transformation. The farm would suit different economic purposes, such as an avocado field or a camping site. It can also be used for horse breeding, as it has stables and natural spring water troughs. There is barely a five minute walk to the village, with all the amenities and entertainment possibilities that this implies, and it is just next to a restaurant with a swimming pool where they serve awesome Andalusian food.
Within the town of Carratraca, the architectural ensemble is shaped by the house of Doña Trinidad Grund (*), turned into City Hall, and the tower next to said house, which you can see from the property plot, whose terraces offer spectacular views of the dramatic mountain surroundings. 
There is a half an hour drive to the Malaga airport and 40 min. drive to the city of Malaga and to the nearest beach. 

(*) Trinidad Grund (1821-1896), a member of nineteenth century Malaga society, paid for the neighbouring Ardales cave to be prepared for an annual festival. It was probably the first cave in Spain to be prepared as a show cave, and was visited by thousands of people.</desc>

    <desc>This spacious house in the very centre of the historic town of Ardales has an entrance hall, five bedrooms, two bathrooms and two terraces with spectacular views to the village and to the countryside. The house is distributed over three floors and there are plenty of storage spaces. It needs a renovation and an adjacent house which belongs to the same family and overlooks a parallel street with a bit more traffic can be purchased for about 40000€ to be transformed into a car parking space. 
Ardales is not only known for its prehistorical caves and stone art. It is situated on one of the two access points to the Caminito del Rey and the Gaitanes canyon, one of the main geologic and sport attractions in the area since it was reopened to the public in year 2015. It has also a clean water reservoir, Pantano de El Chorro, where locals can swim in perfect peace and solitude.</desc>

    <desc>If one has read Don Quixote and has in mind the inns where Sancho and the knight stopped and lived their adventures, one will know how to recognize the unmistakable half Manchego half Andalusian air given off by this property, located in a neighbourhood of Pizarra called Cerralba, just twenty minutes from Malaga airport.
And even for those who have not read that book, the village, of about 1000 inhabitants, will seduce you by its strategic position in the heart of the Guadalhorce valley, very close to the lively Pizarra, and equipped with several bars, a pharmacy a few meters from this property and a great environment surrounded by mountains and half an hour driving distance from the Mediterranean (Málaga, Fuengirola, Mijas or Torremolinos). 
This house has two entrances, one has direct access to the house, through a landscaped hallway and a hall that has a master bedroom to the right. We go up the stairs and we see a small room on the right (that can be used as a study), a bathroom and two further bedrooms. Returning to the ground floor, we have a second bathroom to the left, and immediately we can enter the living room, and the kitchen in the back. The patio becomes a wonderful garden of mandarin trees, and walking a quite long way we reach the area of the hayloft, the garages and a space of old stables that still preserve the watering holes for the animals.</desc>

    <desc>Located in the very heart of Cartama, a city of 27,000 inhabitants only a few km from Malaga and ten minutes from its airport, in the Plaza de la Constitucion and next to San Pedro church, is this huge property whose interior needs be renovated to regain its habitability and become the best house in the entire town. Its main entrance, next to a garage that can be transformed into a commercial space, leads us through a hall to a door that leads to the patio and the garden. We have 2 rooms in this ground floor, 4 on the first one and 3 on the second one. There are 6 balconies facing the square and one covered terrace facing the back garden, which has also an own terrace. 
Without  doubt a property with the highest potential to become your dream Andalucian home or because of its location, offers the opportunity to create a Bed and Breakfast or small Hotel.</desc>

    <desc>If there is a peculiarity of the houses in southern Spain, it is that they hide unexpected spaces, shady patios, gardens and flower beds, panoramic ceilings, dining rooms with fireplaces, surprising attics, rooms that remind us of caves and, ultimately, the Nasrid. The Islamic tradition is perpetuated to go unnoticed a series of cavities of rest and protection of the home. This house conforms to that canon of philosophy of life. It is modest in the façade that faces the street where the front door is located, and upon entering, we are surprised by its spaciousness. There is a space that acts as a corridor, to the right you enter a corridor with steps that lead to a living room, kitchen and patio, equipped with a storage room and garage, as well as two bathrooms, one of them very large and complete. We returned to the hall. The central door is a room, which can be used for friends or visitors, or it can be rented to guests. The third door, to the left of the corridor, leads to a "new world" of rooms, first, after some stairs, to a still unfinished space, spacious and with panoramic views from its windows. Follow the ascent up the stairs and to your right we access another corridor, two bedrooms, one of them the main one, with two large windows that overlook the street, and when we return to that corridor we find another bathroom and a dressing room. We go up to the next level and find a new apartment with rooms, four in total, the largest of which also enjoys privileged views towards the mountain. There is also an attic with a private bathroom. Finally we go up to the terrace and the panorama may surprise us. There is a barbecue and a nice case for the stairs. The house is partially renovated, as is the case with the roof, but other parts need some care.</desc>

    <desc>This 7 bedroom villa situated in the very popular and picturesque village of Comares is definitely worth a look at.  The village of Comares, which is situated at 703m above sea level, is beautifully wedged on a enormous rock which over looks the Axarquia in it's whole. The name ''Comares'' originally comes from the Greek term ''Komaron'' (land of arbutus), although the Arabs with their culture decided to rename it ''Hisn Comarix'' (castle in high land). The population of Comares is on average 1500. Here you will find all the necessities you will need, such as supermarkets, banks, medical centres, pharmacies, bars, restaurants, etc. The accessibility to Comares is very good, as it is accessed on the main road from the Axarquia's capital Velez Malaga, which is a 15 minute drive away. The beach is only 20 minutes in car and Malaga airport 50 minutes. The property is located 3 minutes drive outside of Comares, also with good accessibility. It is divided into two separate accommodation areas, one upstairs one downstairs. The downstairs accomodation has 4 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, with the kitchen an living area on a open plan lounge diner basis. All bedrooms are light and spacious. This accommodation is separate to the upstairs and could be used as a rental opportunity. Upstairs, which is the more modern accommodation area, has 3 double bed bedrooms and one including an en suite. There is also a guest toilet. The living and kitchen area is the same as downstairs. The terrace area with a lovely BBQ has stunning views over the countryside. There is also a ping pong table plus a generous in size swimming pool with real grass surrounding it for you to relax.</desc>

    <desc>A very substantial property in a great location on the edge of the village of Bermejo. Within walking distance of shops, bars and school, this 5 bedroom property just needs a bit of, mainly cosmetic, attention to resore it to its former glory.  A covered terrace stretches the full with of the front of the house and looks over the 25m2 pool and surrounding terraces. From here you enter into a hall area with doors to a double bedroom, large living area with open fire, fully fitte kitchen and a cloakroom with toilet and wash basin. A wide stairway leads to the first floor landing and from here to 4 double bedrooms and a bathroom.

Outside, there are several large concreted areas, currently for the dogs and, to the side, a good sized garage with a terrace over,which needs tiling and balustrading replacing. On the opposite side a double gate gives access to a parking area.

All in all a great property at a very good price, which just needs a little love and DIY.</desc>

    <desc>Such a difficult house to describe as it is actually 2 houses on one titledeed with separate entrances onto a quiet pedestrianised street in the centre of town. One door leads directly to a flight of stairs and up to a living area, large bedroom, galley kitchen, bathroom, a further bedroom and terrace. The second front door leads to an entrance hall, living room, second sitting room/bedroom, good sized kitchen and two interlinking bedrooms and a tiled bathroom, a tiled yard leads to a separate 2 storey building at the rear with a downstairs room and a spiral staircase leading up the roof terrace. A property with a lot of potential as a family home and for letting. In need of some mainly cosmetic work and updating, but at this price, a definite bargain.</desc>

    <desc>Built in the early 90s, this unique house combines Spanish style with Western European design. Built around 3 sides of a courtyard, it offers flexible accommodation, a registered 491m2 and a vast amount of useable land, with breath taking views.The approach is via a tarmac road and 1km of country track and then an entrance driveway to the rear of the house and double garage. The accommodation is arranged to suit the needs of the current owner, but rooms can easily be redesigned to provide additional bedrooms etc. The house, unusually, has a large number of external doors, making it easy to provide individual units for letting if required. Entered from a beautiful covered terrace overlooking the infinity pool, the main living room is a grand space dominated by a raised open fireplace. On one side, the dining area is divided by a low sideboard unit and from the there into an excellent fitted kitchen with ample unit and space for a breakfast table. From here a corridor leads to a double utility room and one bedroom, currently used as a study/snug. There is also an external door leading into the courtyard. On the opposite side of the lounge we have a spacious bedroom and well appointed bathroom suite. From this area you can access the third side of the building which has been used as letting accommodation in the past and currently provides a living area, kitchenette, bedroom, with WC and basin and access to the courtyard. Also on this side is another room with WC and basin, currently not used, but a potential letting room.</desc>

    <desc>This is a very nicely restored and maintained, ready to move into town house on the edge of the small town of La Bobadilla located between Martos and Alcaudete in the Jaen province of Andalucia, Spain. Step off the street, with on road parking right outside the property, into a nice sized living room, off which are the stairs and doorway to the lovely large kitchen diner. The modern kitchen has granite worktops giving lots of workspace and an open fireplace where a gas heater sits at present but a wood burner could happily sit in it. Through the kitchen is a conservatory with a wall of glass for those beautiful views, off which is a shower room. This sunny room makes a great second lounge or it could be a dining room. Step out of the sliding doors onto a patio and down some steps into the easy care garden. Go up the stairs into a good sized double bedroom and through a curtain is a hallway off which is another double bedroom with access to a private sun terrace and a large shower room. Just a lovely property and home wanting new owners.</desc>

    <desc>Fantastic opportunity to grab a real slice of the Andalucian Countryside.  Lovely Chalet style Finca with its own very private swimming pool (6.00x8.00m2) with stunning panoramic views and situated on an enormous plot of land of over 14,500m2. The well presented land has many olive trees with both eating olives and oil producing olives.  The property has an excellent sized lounge area with wood burning open fireplace, a newly fitted spacious kitchen with plenty of room for dining, 3 good sized bedrooms and a shower room with WC and wash basin.  This property has a very Andalucian style to it and is in a very quiet and private situation, but still only 2kms from the main A92 motorway and just 2.5kms to the beautiful, bustling town of La Puebla de Cazalla with its many bars, restaurants and shops.</desc>

    <desc>EXCLUSIVE to Us. This house is just a few minutes walk from bars and shops in Fuensanta de Martos in the Jaen province of Andalucia, Spain. Enter the front door off the road into the living room with fireplace and wooden stairs, ahead is a small dining area with a fold up table and the new, small but perfectly formed kitchen. There is also a utility, office or store room with cupboard and a shower room. Up the stairs and you go directly into the double bedroom with a bath en suite. This house has no outside space, it is a great base for holidays and exploring. Just next door (and on top of the kitchen and backroom) is TH4629 so it is possible to turn the two into one with a roof terrace for a lovely big house. TH4622 is also just across the lane.</desc>

    <desc>Ready to move into this 2 Bedroom, 2 bathroom, town house is situated in the popular historical town of Alcaudete, in the Jaen province of Andalucia, located on a quiet street with lots of parking a few houses down. Enter the original wooden door into the living room with stairs off to the left and an under stair cupboard. Ahead is the dining room with a door to the patio and access to the kitchen. The Andalusian tiled patio has a shower room, and a covered area where the washing machine and washing sink is, then there are steps up to a storage room. Take the roof of this room and it would make a nice sized roof terrace with castle and mountain views.

    <desc>This semi-detached Cortijo and former farmhouse is located in the municipality of Cútar in the interior of the Axarquía region, province of Málaga. The owner says that the property could be over 400 years old, as it has been passed down from generation to generation within his own family. The property consists of 148 square metres of constructed area of which approximately half or a little more could be used while the other half is being reformed. The house consists of living dining room with fireplace and an antique kitchen with fireplace, bathroom with shower and 3 double bedrooms. To the right side of the house is the part of the property that needs to be reformed to make full use of the total build size and it comprises many areas that could be used in different ways by the new owners. The vendor says that the existing stone wall on the house could be 500 years old. The property has a generous size plot of 15,304 square metres where there are currently 20 productive olive trees but with enough space to plant whatever is desired. The property has water and electricity from the village and 2 wells and shares with the neighbour its own oven to bake any kind of food, especially bread. There are people who love these types of old properties that still retain the original features of their construction, so here we have one for you. The property is only 3km from the provincial road A-356, which links the villages of Casbermeja and Velez Malaga in a few minutes passing over the magnificent reservoir of La Viñuela.</desc>

    <desc>Large 5 bedrooms townhouse located at the entrance of Casarabonela, with just 40 minutes driving to the airport and the coast. It is very close to all amenities such as supermarkets, restaurants, schools, doctor surgery and the village's swimming pool. It also has a bus service to Málaga.  
At the front of the house there is mirador with amazing views. The front door opens in to the living room. The kitchen is well equipped and still keeps the fireplace where the food was once cooked in the older times.. Also off the kitchen there is an utility area, a bathroom, and a  storage room. Steps from the living room leads to a bedroom and a staircase from the living room leads up to the first floor living area or bedroom with a further three more bedrooms. A door from one of the bedrooms leads you to a walkway with steps up to the roof terrace, where there are two more rooms suitable to be used as double bedrooms. The terrace enjoys excellent views of the village and also the countryside right down to the coast, where you can see the sea on the clearest days. 
Next to the front terrace a door gives access to the attached old barn of the property and stables. This has an arched room that used to be the stables, and there is an enormous room cut in to the rock, with windows to one side. This room adjoins the kitchen and utility room in the main house and could be joined as the floor levels are very similar. There would be the possibility of having two floors in this room, so it could be converted as a two floor apartment. A great opportunity, not to be missed.</desc>

    <desc>This lovely property looks like a fairly small townhouse from the facade but once inside, this property keeps going and going offering lots of surprises for a house in the centre of town. The main entrance opens in to a traditionally tiled private courtyard, decorated with terracotta pots and with a partially covered sitting area for those hot summer afternoons. The courtyard leads to an outside bathroom, a separate utility room, a storage room and a second small walled courtyard, where the current owner has placed their washing line. Inside, this property has been loved and is in good order throughout. The ground floor has a fully fitted kitchen with plenty of storage, two spacious sitting rooms, a separate dining room and 2 double bedrooms, one of which has a large en suite bathroom. On the first floor there are 3 more double bedrooms to the rear of the house and one large room that runs from one end to the other, with exposed beamed ceilings. This room traditionally would be where the family stored there vegetables, olives and jamon, making catering for a large family a little easier and now, this space could lend itself to many things... Fantastic property well worth viewing !</desc>

    <desc>This is an opportunity to purchase 4 separate parcels of land, totalling 27,062m2, all within close proximity of each other and just a short five minute drive from the town of Fuente de Piedra. All 4 plots have good access with a good track that runs along the side of the A92. 3 of the plots consist solely of olives and have all mature established trees, the forth plot is fenced and the previous owner had thought about constructing a nave for machinery.
These plots are all owned by one family and bring in a good yearly revenue.</desc>

    <desc>This property  had a major reform a few years ago. New wiring, plumbing, 1st floor tiling and roof terrace. It just needed finishing off with decoration and new kitchen. But it is a long time that no one has lived there and now it needs a good renovation. Even a new floor is required on ground floor, hence project price. 
From the entrance you are directly into the lounge and in front, to the rear is a large room used as a double bedroom. Off this bedroom is a toilet and shower room, which also includes the utility activities. The lounge benefits from a large log-burner. The left of the lounge leads to the kitchen area. The property includes all the white goods. The staircase from the lounge leads to the 1st floor which has all new tiling and is mostly open plan to accommodate 4 bedrooms, toilet and shower. Another staircase leads to the large roof terrace with great views over the countryside.. This quiet hamlet is only 30 minutes from Granada</desc>

    <desc>A very unique country house located in an idyllic setting, very isolated and quiet. This home is top quality and very rarely does a property of this type come on the market. It was built in 1997 for its current owner who now has ... reached retirement age and wants a smaller property. (Part of the exchange for a smaller farm or villa would be considered). It has been drastically reduced from 1,285,000 euros, so it represents a wonderful opportunity to buy at a very realistic price. ..The closest beach: 25 min. by car. Shops / restaurants: 5 min. by car.</desc>

In addition to the main house, it has other buildings at different levels closed and covered, that can also be accessed from another street,  and which could be converted into more living and entertainment areas or you could use the space as a plot to build another house. It is southwest facing and has magnificent views of the Sierra de Alcaparaín.
 The town of Carratraca is 45 km along the A-357 road from Malaga, and is well connected to the cosmopolitan Costa del Sol and Marbella, making the journey by car in only 35 minutes. The study of the future Guadalhorce motorway, which will connect it with the Costa del Sol, is currently underway.
This beautiful village has been a reference point for health tourism for more than two centuries, although the properties of the sulphurous springs were discovered much earlier. The origin of its famous spa is to be found in the Roman baths and the Arab baths, which were created in the municipality to take advantage of the mineral-medicinal powers of its spring. The town has been declared an Asset of Cultural Interest. It is very interesting to visit the spa, inaugurated in 1855; the mansion of Mrs. Trinidad Grund; the bullring inaugurated in 1878 and the church of Nuestra Señora de la Salud. In the surrounding area you can visit the reservoir of Conde de Guadalhorce and the gorge with the amazing Caminito del Rey.</desc>

    <desc>This amazing building sits just a few minutes walk from the beautiful town of Antequera on the walkers and cyclists route, perfect to explore the stunning countryside which surrounds Antequera. The property has great access and whilst standing at the front door all you can hear is the water cascading down the waterfall which is located to the left of the property. The property is mainly vacant. It used to be a thriving agricultural business. Now empty, you can appreciate the shear size of the build and take in some of it's truly beautiful features which include beamed ceiling's and arched set windows . The current owners have two small living accommodations on separate sides of the building. One they use for the winter months and the other in the summer as it's cooler. Although the living areas are small they both have rustic kitchens, full bathroom's and bedrooms. This property would be a perfect project for someone wanting to open a business or create and incredible home. Really must be seen to be appreciated.</desc>

    <desc>Exclusive to Us. If quality living space is what you are looking for, this superbly spacious town house is for you. Suitable for a big family or as an investment to very easily create two different homes whether for renting or reselling. The property is located in the popular town of Puente Genil, just a short drive from motorways A-45 and A92-M, which connect Málaga, Sevilla, Córdoba and Granada. This property is full of character and sits in the vicinity of all amenities in the town, on a sought after street. The house has two entrance ways, either via the garage or the main entrance door, situated next to each other. The garage has more than generous proportions and a tool room inside. As you enter the house through the main door, you are welcomed by a small hallway and the stairs that allow direct access to the first floor. On your left, there is a door to enter the garage. Straight ahead, a cosy patio leads to the 1st floor kitchen on the right and a double bedroom on the left hand side. Past the kitchen on the right, you find a bathroom, past which you enter a spacious and bright living / dining area, complete with an open fire and access to the main patio on the left. The patio has a staircase leading up to the first floor. Right past the living area, you find two adjacent double bedrooms. Making our way back to the entrance hall, we go upstairs and access a good size living room which, on the left, leads to a double bedroom with street views. On the right, there is a smaller bedroom, past which you can find another big kitchen area on the left and a bathroom on the right. After the bathroom, there is a little laundry space leading to a nice terrace area, connected via stairs to the main ground floor patio, at the end of which you find two further bedrooms. From this area, a staircase leads up to the main roof terrace, which sports great town and countryside views. Set in a nice neighbourhood, the townhouse just needs the installation of one or two kitchens depending on your own designs and a little updating with a fresh coat of paint to create a spacious home in the sun.</desc>

Both houses have a balcony in front which can be opened via a small gate in the centre to have one big balcony.

    <desc>EXCLUSIVE to us. This rural countryside home situated in Los Rosales comes with a generous plot size of 496m2 and is close to the popular town of Frailes and just a short drive to the large historical city of Alcala la Real in the Jaen province of Andalucia. The Cortijo has electricity and town water connections and is priced to sell, needing updating throughout. The 3 bedroom property boasts spectacular countryside views and offers the opportunity to create a wonderful rural home in the warm sunshine of southern Spain. Located in an elevated position you have plenty of off road parking to the front of the Cortijo. You enter the property into a hallway with a kitchen area to the right, a separate dining room on the left which leads to a lounge. Stairs take you up to the first floor where you have 3 good sized rooms all needing some reform, as does the roof. There are also 2 storage rooms needing renovation but could be converted into useable spaces. The Property also comes with a private garage which has an upper floor. On the market for under 40 thousand euros this rural Cortijo would be ideal for a professional renovator, experienced builder or for the new owners to employ qualified local tradesmen as having water and electricity on site will make the conversion that much easier and cost effective.</desc>

    <desc>This 3 Bedroom property with outside space is located close to the town square of the pretty town of La Roda de Andalucia, in the Sevilla province of Andalucia, located within easy walking distance to all the local amenities including shops, bars and restaurants. The property was bought as a project and the current owners started by having a new roof installed and raised the height of the property. Unfortunately due to circumstances the project has not gone much further, the ground floor has an entrance hall with feature archway leading in to a central living area, a ground floor bedroom and kitchen area and bathroom. Stairwell to the first floor leads to 2 bedrooms with windows to the front and back overlooking the outside garden space which includes a storage shed and utility area. With the main expense of a new roof out of the way you now have the opportunity to finish the renovation as a D.I.Y. project or as a sound investment using local tradesmen.</desc>

    <desc>Situated in a rural location in Las Caserias, which is only 4.4kms from the popular historical city of Alcala La Real in the Jaen province of Andalucia. This 3 bedroom countryside home comes with a generous sized plot of 4,457m2 with its own private drive and stunning views. In need of renovation throughout, the property has electricity connected and well water but is priced to sell and gives the new owner the opportunity to create a private rural home with lots of land in the wonderful Andalucian countryside. You approach the property via a private drive which leads to a car port and you enter the Cortijo into a lounge with 1 double bedroom on the right. Ahead is a room which could be a separate diner or a ground floor bathroom. From the lounge you access the kitchen area with an open fireplace. Stairs lead up to the large unconverted first floor where you have space for 2 further bedrooms and a bathroom. This Cortjo property is all about the substantial private land and those spectacular views plus with electricity already on site should ensure this renovation project could be carried out on a limited budget if needed.</desc>

    <desc>This charming investment opportunity to own this chalet constructed in 1996 with 5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in the quiet hamlet of El Garabato . Situated on the edge with direct access to the olive grove. As part of a local cooperative, the owners enjoy an annual revenue of 30.000 €. Nothing elaborate about the accommodation as it is real rural living with your livestock and farm equipment to the left. In our opinion, the value of the crop and land investment covers the entire purchase cost, so your bonus is the property to rent out or provide a bit of TLC to enjoy the real Spanish Lifestyle.</desc>

    <desc>A large character 329m2 build townhouse is full of traditional Spanish features at an amazing price.  The former coach house requires reform throughout, but the present owners have already prepared plans for this project to take place with an architect. The property has stunning character and rustic accents throughout with the high beamed ceilings, arched doorways, irregular shaped corridors. This unique property has potential for a successful bed &amp; breakfast or a large family home. You enter the property through huge wooden doors along a cobbled hallway that runs the 20m length of the building to the rear.  A dining room at the front and an open lounge area, plus another almost identical room. A small corridor leads through to the fitted kitchen, with doors out to the internal patio. All electrics are upgraded to the maximum available (5.5kw). The bathroom is off the internal patio. Upstairs, on a “mezzanine”, is a large, long, low-beamed roofed bedroom. On the next level is the main family bathroom which still needs to be completed. Further up is another large bedroom, with very high beamed ceiling, a large open plan sitting room leads to two more front double bedrooms, with high sloping beamed roofs and shutter windows with balconies looking over the street. A final flight of stairs, with a cupboard underneath, leads up to the big attic room, with low beamed ceilings.  Outbuildings: At the end of the first patio, through a huge arch, is the first of the outbuildings, which could easily be converted, rustic stairs from here lead up to a huge room with high beamed ceilings and arched alcoves. The main patio area is overgrown with stables off, which still contain the tether rings, a grain chute and water troughs. Above is a large feed store area that could also be converted to accommodation, office space, or workshops anything is possible!  MUST BEEN SEEN</desc>

    <desc>EXCLUSIVE to us. This Cortijo of approximately 80 square metres is located in the Campo del Castillo de Gómez Arias, an emblematic place in the history of Benamejí, in the province of Córdoba. Its quiet location allows anyone to disconnect from the noise and stress of the big cities. This Cortijo and extensive land has always been used as an irrigated orchard, because it has a fertile plot of 13.525 square metres and one of its boundaries is the Genil River. This property is in need of renovation and currently there are 2 bedrooms, living-dining room, kitchen and store room but once finished you will have a countryside home in an idyllic location between the river and the pine forests that surround it. It can be reached in a few minutes drive from the A-45 motorway linking the provinces of Malaga and Cordoba.</desc>

    <desc>Enormous potential with this large bar reception room on street level, disco with bar and DJ booth on lower, street level and lounge, 2 bedrooms, kitchen , utility room and access onto the huge terrace on the first floor. The terrace overlooks olive groves at the back and further stairs to the 2nd floor where you have another bedroom and roof terrace overlooking the front. From the street there are two doors, one into the bar and one to stairs up to the living accommodation with a further door connecting them both. The front part of the bar is large and leads through to a larger restaurant area or function room with kitchen and stairs lead up to the very big roof terrace as well as other stairs down to the disco / club with exits onto the street at the back. This has lots of potential to become commercial use again or to make three separate living quarters or turn the downstairs into garages. Imagine what you can do with a property with a total of 423 square metres built!</desc>

    <desc>This well presented furnished Townhouse in the center of Rute stands in a quiet wide street with parking space in front of the door and a street which is not steep. If you know Rute this is quite important as some streets can be steep and narrow. The house has had some recent renovations done, with a new facade, new bathroom and kitchen. Coming inside in this townhouse you feel at home. There is a wood burner in your nice living space, a fitted kitchen , and an outdoor bathroom. Going then outside you really have the privacy that you sometimes miss in a townhouse but here not. A romantic evening in the hot tub with a glass of wine and enjoying without having eyes on your patio is definitely a plus. More benefits are that the boiler electrics and plumbing are all new. On the first floor, you have a second new bathroom, 2 double bedrooms, and a single bedroom. Well worth viewing for people who want to live close to a center with all amenities within walking distance, but still want to be located on a quiet, wide street with easy parking.</desc>

Once outside on the back, you have a nice garden with a swimming pool that needs an upgrade but once this is done you even have a view from your swimming pool to the mountain. This is really a bargain property that needs to be seen!!!!!</desc>

    <desc>This pretty house is located in the very historic centre of Antequera, one of the most monumental cities in Andalucia, and next to the famous Arch of the Giants (built during the Renaissance). It is also totally attached to the Muslim citadel's ramparts and located on a quiet street with views to the horizon and to the rock of Los Enamorados (popularly known as the "the Indian head")  from its balconies.
The first thing that captivates us about the property is its hall, with beautiful tiles. We have on our left a bedroom and going up the stairs two more bedrooms, with their own balconies. To the right of the stairs is the kitchen and a pantry, preceded by a dining room. Already in the patio on the right hand side we find a recently renovated blue bathroom equipped with a shower. The patio is special both for what is seen and for what is not seen:
What you can see are the walls of the citadel. What you cannot see is a cave sealed by a wall behind a green metal ladder that can be opened by carrying out simple masonry work and used i.e. as a wine cellar. We go up the green ladder and we find a terrace with a barbecue. There is a second bathroom also on the terrace. 
The property stands out for its agreeable symbiosis between interior and patio, for its peace, thanks to the views of the horizon from the balconies and the fortification from the patio, as well as the mysterious aura of a cave once connected with other cavities and passages.</desc>

    <desc>Magnificent independent house (with penthouse possibility, already prebuilt) in Andalusian style privilegedly located in an olive grove in the middle of the city of Ronda, between the monumental part and a modern neighborhood with schools, pharmacies, a gas station, a hospital and next to a bus stop, since a main road passes close to the property. The house can be fitted with the upper part, which currently serves as a loft or attic. At the entrance we find a spacious living room with a fireplace, followed by a dining room and kitchen  on your right. There are three bedrooms, one of them with an ensuite bathroom. The house is very cool in summer - no need to switch on the air conditioning  - and is surrounded by a garden that allows for more than two cars to park widely and also the construction of a swimming pool. Direct views of the old town and the Church of Santa María la Mayor, the main church in the city from which its bells are heard, give this property a feeling of exclusivity and well-being.</desc>

    <desc>As it is usual in the tradition in many other rural properties and small Andalusian towns, one does not wait for the box of surprises that this property houses, contemplating the facade before entering through the threshold. This threshold is somewhat elevated with respect to the street, where you can park easily, and we go to the lounge that makes the hall, the coolest room in summer and really very spacious. After a few steps and we will see in the background the kitchen, on the left a patio to which we will return and on the right the stairs that connect us with 3 rooms, the main one, with balconies to the street, an intermediate one and a third one with an ensuite bathroom and a door with stairs to the two terraces, one facing the street and the castle, and the other facing the garden. Between the two terraces there is a spacious laundry room. Let's go back to the patio, where some stairs will take us to the orchard and the corral, a very wide "private world" provided with a corral, a stable and spectacular views of the Al Mundat fortress, the town of Monda and the surrounding mountains.</desc>

    <desc>Upon entering this house, the visitor is overwhelmed by a feeling of peace and quietness. We are in El Burgo, a mountain town surrounded by imposing peaks and the unique ecosystem of the Sierra de las Nieves. We cross the living room, which has an adjoining bedroom, and we go to a big hall where the stairs lead us to a spacious bedroom area, one of them with an ensuite bathroom and a panoramic terrace that can be used as a solarium. Two other rooms have balconies that face the street, with lovely views over the Andalusian-style roofs. On the ground floor there is access to the kitchen, with its own fireplace, after passing a bright interior patio. Finally we come to a large garden with direct views to the Cerro de la Blanquilla (1506m) and here we find, in addition to rose bushes, an impressive pinsapo fir, a protected species that only exists in these mountains and in northern Morocco. Older shepherds say that you never suffer the summer heat under one of those mystical trees.</desc>

    <desc>This beautiful rural hotel with a complete equipped bar-restaurant, a pleasant patio and balconies in almost each of its 13 rooms (with their ensuite bathrooms) is characterized by a familiar and cozy atmosphere. Located in the most central street of the mountain village El Burgo, this building is an ideal investment to lead a sustainable and ecological business, away from the large urban agglomerations and surrounded by the Sierra Laquebrilla and the Sierra de las Nieves Biosphere Reserves. The wooden ceilings, the furniture and the decoration, as well as the shaded patio and the views of the neighboring church of San Agustín, give this corner mansion a magnificent air of an old and stately town property. The inn received numerous recognitions and awards for its uniqueness in the 1990s and early 2000s.</desc>

    <desc>Open the old painted folding gates and be amazed at the space within. Hidden within walls there might be no view but there a long mural down one side of the patio opposite the double doors into the living space. Kitchen, diner and lounge merge into one delightful warm room. Off this is a small double bedroom and up some short open stairs is the bathroom and a bedroom with built in lit cupboard.
With excellent use of space, great taste and quality craftsmanship this is an extremely private, unique bolthole on a dead end street in a lively little town.</desc>

    <desc>This corner house needs modernizing but can be lived in now. Enter the front door into a hallway which leads into the living room and on down to the decent sized kitchen and patio. The patio, if sheds etc. are cleared would make a good size, flat area. From the living is a front room, now used as a bedroom, and steps up to another room, also used as a bedroom, off which are the stairs behind a door. Upstairs leads to a landing area and to the right is an old beam and bamboo roof. Take this off to make a nice roof terrace. To the left one room with nice old beams leads into another. This could be a really cosy house with both a patio and terrace but it also can be lived in now once the electricity is reconnected.</desc>

    <desc>Just a short distance through the olive groves of Monte Lopez Alvarez we find this charming semi detached cortijo among  a cluster of houses. Open the front door to see olives trees opposite, drive down the track and you see the enormous garage facing you. The house itself has been semi renovated with new first fix electrics, new tiled floors down stairs and partially new floors and original tiles upstairs and new roof. Enter the front door into a large open living room with open fire and semi divided kitchen area with reclaimed train sleepers. Through the lounge is another open area which leads to the old stable part and out onto a long patio. Heading up the stairs on the turn is the planned access to the back of the garage and bathroom with sewage pipe in place.
Upstairs there could be five bedrooms, one already separated as a room in the middle and the back has one room leading to the other with original hydraulic tiles in one part and cleaned original terracotta clay tiles in the other part. At the front of the house one large room leads to another with olive grove views.</desc>

    <desc>This beautiful property is just outside the town of Fuensanta de Martos. There is a lane leading up to several houses with parking right in front of the door. Enter the front door and you are greeted by a kitchen / diner which features an original fireplace with a wood burner. Off the kitchen to the left there is a toilet, then you come to a good sized lounge with a door leading out onto a pretty, enclosed patio.  
If you love the sun then you are going to love this outside space for relaxing and pottering.  Great for barbecues and enjoying the Spanish weather. There's a good sized workshop off the patio. Traditional Spanish stairs lead to the first floor where  you have a large family bathroom, along with a great sized double bedroom with a large built in wardrobe. A window seat gives you great views over the countryside.  
On this floor is a smaller single bedroom or if needed, a study. Off the landing you then have stairs leading up into the second floor where you have a  huge master bedroom along with its own en-suite, it could be split into two smaller rooms if needed. This property really is worth seeing and perfect for a holiday home, it needs painting inside and out (and we have a quote for that)  but otherwise it is ready to move into.</desc>

    <desc>This Large 149m2 built 4 Bedroom, 2 Bathroom Townhouse is situated in the beautiful town of Rute in the Cordoba region of Andalucia and only a short drive to wonderful Lake Iznajar. With on road parking, you enter the double fronted property in to a large reception / dining area with 1 ground floor double bedroom, a lounge, the fitted kitchen and access to a private patio where you have a fully tiled bathroom plus utility room leading to a further tiled shower room. From the patio, there are steps down to outside garden spaces which have room to add a small pool. Stairs close to the kitchen area lead to the first floor where you have 3 double / twin bedrooms plus a further room which could be a bathroom, dressing room, or a single bedroom. From this floor, you have stairs taking you up to the large unconverted attic spaces where more living rooms can be accommodated. The property has town water supply but the electricity will need to be reconnected; this is reflected in the asking price and offers you the opportunity to purchase a large Spanish Family Home in the warm sunshine of southern Spain at a bargain price.</desc>

    <desc>If you are put off by a bumpy track, stop reading, this is not the property for you. But if not and you plan to have a high car anyway, you have come to this idyllic new build rural home set in grounds of 25,000m2 of countryside. Through the gated driveway, you come to the side of this beautiful house. As you walk to the front South facing porch you have views all around. Entering through the porch into the main spacious lounge with high sloped ceilings, there is a fireplace to the right and an open kitchen at the back with a side door leading out to the driveway. To the left there are two big double bedrooms and a family bathroom with a bath. Wooden staircase leads to the loft landing upstairs that lends itself to an office or a second sitting room, then it opens into the brightest master suite you have seen. It has a dressing corner and bathroom en-suite along with French balcony door offering amazing views over the beautiful surrounding hills and the whole of Guaro village, that is only 4 km away by road. To the West of the property is a double garage with a third bathroom. This will take two cars or can be converted into a further two bedrooms or even a self-contained studio apartment. The BBQ and patio area wraps around the house into the land, passing some outbuildings, storage and chicken sheds. There are neighbours around, so this is not a remote location, but private and wonderfully comfortable. With mains water and electrics, and even gasoil central heating installed, this property really welcomes you to make it your new home. Book to view in person or virtually as soon as possible!</desc>

    <desc>This old fashioned town house with its lengthy entrance way has more to it than meets the eye. Having a built size of 176 m2 this could be a very rewarding project for somebody. Replace the entrance gates for a private entrance to the chocolate box house. On entering the original wooden double doors you are in a largish sitting room with an open fireplace at one end and to the right a staircase to the first floor. Straight ahead is a utility room that leads out to the patio with its sheds. Remove the sheds and you get a great sized patio, walled on two sides. Off the sitting room is the ample sized kitchen. By the fireplace is a curtained entrance into another large room that is also used as a store. At the top of the stairs there is 1 bedroom to your left and another one straight ahead which leads to another room - the present pigeon house! This has a door into another room above the store. On the left of the gateway is a small garage with rooms behind for a separate apartment or remove them for an impressive view of the house.</desc>

Great Property well worth viewing!</desc>

    <desc>Quirky corner house with great sized roof terrace and far reaching views. Antique lovers have been restoring this four storey town house. It is not finished but it is liveable in. With planning permission in place to convert the garage into three more rooms and another larger roof terrace  (at an estimated cost of 27,000€) this would make a fabulous Bed and Breakfast in the old part of town, or just leave it as it is. Enter the original, wooden, double doors into an entrance area with open stairs and an entrance into the long sitting room, another into where there was a fireplace and then into the lovely kitchen almost finished except the ceiling. Out the back door is a smallish patio with steps to the garage and another room with a fireplace which in the plans is added to the main sitting room.

    <desc>This beautifully restored town house next to the church and on the foundations of a Moorish tower has a privileged position in the town of Pegalajar, with hiking, climbing and hang gliding nearby and less than 1 hour from Granada airport. With stunning views of Sierra Magina it is ready to live in with the possibility to add to it or easily make it into two units. The garage, roof terrace and room below could easily be divided from the main entrance with patio, large lounge and four bedrooms or leave as it is for a lovely, family home that is full of light. The present owner had further plans to build a roof terrace on top of the garage for even better views of Sierra Magina and privacy and add a small pool or Jacuzzi. This is a really lovely, unusual house with original features and quirky twists, quiet too as there is no passing traffic, just access to the garage and the neighbours garage. It is available furnished with some very nice antique pieces or unfurnished.</desc>

    <desc>This large house just requires updating and it would make a lovely family home. With two rooms on either side of the entrance hall which are used as 2 bedrooms then a couple of steps lead into a large lounge with stairs off and under stair cupboard. Walk on through and the kitchen is on the left, a store room - boiler room and shower room on the right. Another couple of steps lead up to a decent sized patio, which if the sheds were removed would make a great private patio area complete with an established Cherry Tree. Upstairs opens onto 1 enormous bedroom which could have an en-suite and a hallway as right now this room leads into another 1 bedroom which then leads to a further double sized room. This is  a lot of house for not much money and without the need to spend too much on it just update and a put a bathroom inside and enjoy the olive grove views and back patio. Perfect to live in or as a holiday home.</desc>

    <desc>Located under an hour from Granada airport and 5 minutes from the main Jaen to Granada road this terraced  house is in the pretty town of Pegalajar. The present owner, who also owns the house next door, had plans to convert them into one  which would make a great sized house and as the end of terrace would give space out the front too as there is no access through. Both are viable in their own right and could make a nice home and a rental house  or buy two and sell one.  It has a new roof, sloping at the front and flat at the back for a roof terrace and a partially finished new electric supply, the electric and water need reconnecting.
Enter the door into a lounge with access out to the kitchen via the back door under the stairs and access up to the patio/garden. The stairs on the right of the front door  go up to 2 bedrooms one with a bathroom. The front room with patio doors and balcony with fabulous views also has more stairs leading up to the attic rooms with potential for more bedrooms or a summer kitchen under the terrace and accessing the garden. Great renovation project in a lovely town. TH4756 and TH4650 are in the same terrace if you want a second property or for family or friends.</desc>

    <desc>A large corner property which comes with a second house.  This would be perfect for someone looking to bring in an income, you could rent out one and live in the other.  The properties are situated in the small plaza of Ribera Alta and close to a bar and shop.  In the larger house, the ground floor offers a kitchen, a downstairs bathroom, a living room, a separate diner and a downstairs bedroom. The first floor consists of 4 more decent sized bedrooms, all with high ceilings. There is also a second bathroom on this level. When you get up to the second floor, there are two rooms which need to be converted; you could either make it into more living space or take advantage of no outside area and make it into a large roof terrace.  The second property needs a full reform but could be made into a beautiful 2 bed property.  This house does benefit from a garden so would be good to rent out. Book your appointment today.</desc>

Laid over three levels, the villa offers 8 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms and a toilet. On the street level, there is a big garage and a lift shaft or storage area. Coming up the stairs, the first set of accommodation of 4  bedrooms with en-suites is found on the same level as the kidney shaped heated swimming pool that you can enjoy all year round. The mild weather of the coastline permits this luxury. In the opposite corner, a summer lounge that could be a guest house or summer kitchen of round shape overlooks the beautiful lawn with the pool in the middle. Coming up to the main house, you will be impressed by the round shape and pillared porch that offers outside dining al fresco and a barbecue area, next to a little garden and a chill-out terrace offering beautiful sea-views. Inside the house, the open plan lounge is very bright and the kitchen is practical, flowing into the round shaped dining room as a central feature.

From this bedroom there is another flight of steps leading into the top of the tower room with feature ceiling beams and saloon doors. The property is currently a rental business property, but can also be a fine and very private primary or secondary residency or combined residency with a business opportunity. All options are open, the sky is the limit!</desc>

    <desc>This 3 double bedroom townhouse is situated in the popular town Canillas de Aceituno in the Axarquia region with a private terrace and balcony. The property is currently used as a local store but can easily be converted into the original townhouse. We enter the house via the store, which is separated in two parts. The ground floor could be used as a sitting area with kitchen. The 2nd floor has 2 rooms that now are used as two storage rooms but would be ideally as two bedrooms. One with a small balcony and the other with an ensuite toilet. The 3th floor with one extra bedroom has access to the private terrace with amazing views.</desc>

    <desc>This fantastic traditional property is full of character and charm with original tiling on the floors and old wooden doors throughout anyone who loves the Andalucia  style will fall in love with this property. Originally the double fronted house was one building but over the years has been divided down the middle to make two independent properties although they share the main entrance hall. Once inside, the passage way leads to a spacious lounge diner with a window to the front of the property. The passage continues to a separate dining room and a room that would be the kitchen with a large pantry. The ground floor opens out on to a private courtyard with outside bathroom and utility and a large storage room and a second room with a huge open fire which would traditionally be the summer kitchen. Back inside the first floor offers a full bathroom and small terrace which looks over the courtyard and continues on to 3 good size bedrooms. A second stairwell leads to the top floor which has had a new floor and shows the new roof this would make great extra living space if needed or an amazing games room with windows to the front, back and side which gives you a glimpse at that gorgeous lake Iznajar.</desc>

    <desc>This beautiful old country house is full of charm and character and surrounded by stunning Andalucian countryside. The property sits within a plot of 850m2 of land consisting of many mature trees and planting, giving plenty of room for someone with green fingers to turn in to a little piece of heaven. Inside, the property is rustic with a traditional kitchen with an open fireplace. The main living area is on the ground floor with a full bathroom, lounge and sitting room. Upstairs there are 4 bedrooms with high beamed ceilings giving each room that extra charm. Outside, there are various outbuildings for storage that could be converted in to more living space or a workshop.
