    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  </data>
  <data name="TownLocationInfohunderedof" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With so many hundreds of white washed villages in Andalucia it's difficult to know which the right one for you. We always suggest that before you start looking for a home, you should spend some time looking for an area. Here in Spain you will spend considerably more time outdoors so it's essential that your environment and surroundings are comfortable. Buy the area first and then you're home!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TownLocationInfosmallvillage" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The small villages in the Antequera, Estepa and Marchena area have all the amenities you'll need but you may need to ask around in the beginning as most shops are run from the ground floor of the proprietor's house and seldom have a sign! A larger town is always nearby for high street shopping and other services.</value>

  <data name="CordobaInfoAcross" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Across the river from the Mezquita is the Alcázar (or fortress) which was built by the Christians in 1328 as a defence against the Muslims. It offers a lovely respite from the summer heat as you wander through the tree shaded gardens and courtyards.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CordobaInfoAsyoumind" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As you wind your way south there are some beautiful whitewashed villages where a friendly welcome can always be found... Puente Genil, Benamejí, Encinas Reales and, of course, Iznajar which is popular for the lake and its beach, and not forgetting La Subbetica natural park which was designated such in 1988 and is home to a miriad of birds, flowers and fauna.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CordobaInfoCity" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As the city is divided, so is the province: The Sierra Morena in the north with its rugged pine and oak covered hills with a few steep villages set into them. The Campiña in the south which are the farmlands covered in wheat, vine and olive trees. The area is famous for its dry white wines, similar to sherry, which are produced from the Pedro Ximenez grape and olive oil, which is the other main produce from the region. This is why olive oil is an important ingredient of many typical dishes, Gazpacho and Salmorejo are cold soups made mainly of mashed vegetables and olive oil and are delicious and refreshing in the heat of the summer. Jamon, which is cured ham, Salchichon, a typical sausage, Caña de Lomo and Morcilla, black pudding are also widely enjoyed in the province. Some typical desserts are Alfajores, made of almonds and honey and Pestiños, which is fried in oil and then coverd with honey.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CordobaInfoCordobaenjoys" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cordoba enjoys its fiestas and festivals the same as every other town in Spain, and Semana Santa, or Easter week is one of the most important. There are no fewer than 32 processions in total with beautifully decorated and ornate pictures and figures of Saints accompanied by the Nazarenos (men dressed in typical gowns with hoods that cover all the face except the eyes). These processions pass through the town followed by crowds of people. In May there are three festivals; from 5th to 12th there is the Festival of the "Patios Cordobeses", a contest for the most beautifully decorated courtyard; the Cruces de Mayo is when the whole town is decorated with crosses and thousands of flowers; the last week in May is when everyone lets their hair down at the Feria de Cordoba - flamenco music and dance are enjoyed and the whole town revels in the festivities.</value>

  <data name="CordobaInfoJewishQuarter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The "Jewish Quarter" or old town, with its small plazas, patios full of colourful flowers and typical bars where tapas are enjoyed, is full of amazing architecture. The Mezquita (or mosque) attracts thousands of visitors each year who flock to admire the magnificent workmanship - it took two centuries to complete and is an amazing jungle of columns, recesses and arches with a church at its centre. Outside the mosque are the beautiful gardens, "the Patio de los Naranjos" and the "Calleja de la Flores".</value>

    <value>Another town which was built as a defence on the western edge of the province is the beautiful town of Loja which spans the Genil river and is surrounding by olive groves and crops. You can still see the evidence of this stronghold today in the ruins of walls and the tower which was once part of the fortress.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfocityof" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The city of Granada was originally known as Ilbyr in prehistoric times when it was inhabited by native tribes and then when the Romans colonised southern Spain they built their own city and it was called Illibris. The present name of Granada came from the Arabs who invaded in the 8th century.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfoheading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Heading west from Granada are some lovely villages, usually at the top of hills where they were built as Moorish defences against the Christians. One of them, close to the Córdoba border, is the stunning town of Montefrio with one of its churches (Iglesia de la Villa) perched on top of a rocky pinnacle. The views from the church are magnificent and, although the church no longer holds services, you can visit the small museum inside and learn all about the church and the castle that stood in its place before its demolition in 1486.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfojustshort" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just a short drive outside Loja, on the river, are several waterfalls which are now a designated protected area. The river is a popular place for fishermen who travel from all over southern Spain to try their hand at catching one of the massive trout that frequent the Rio Genil.</value>

  <data name="GranadaInfoprovience" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>GRANADA Province is situated in the eastern part of the autonomous region of Andalucia, is bordered by the provinces of Málaga, Córdoba, Jaén, Albacete, Murcia, Almería and stretches down to the Mediterranean sea. It's total area is 12,635km2 and contains 168 municipalities.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfoprovienceboasts" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Granada province boasts the tallest mountain in continental Spain, Mulhacén, at 3,481 metres as well as the Sierra Nevada mountain range (the most southerly ski resort in Europe). During the winter months, tourists flock to the Sierra Nevada for the skiing and mountain climbing, but Granada city is popular the year round for its Moorish architecture and the famous Alhambra, with its palaces and gardens. Not forgetting the cave dwellings dotted about the Sacromonte hill to the north of the city which was once the home of Granada's large gypsy community.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfothehill" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The hill facing the Alhambra is called the Albaicin and if you wind your way up through the narrow streets, past all the whitewashed houses, you will reach the highest point with amazing views of the Alhambra and the many differing landscapes of Granada province.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfotheserieaa" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Sierra Nevada was designated a natural park in 1989 and a national park in 1998 and is shared by Granada and Almería provinces. The Alpujarras, the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, are well known for the distinctive Berber architecture of whitish grey box-shaped houses with flat clay roofs and the unique irrigation aqueducts that are still in use by local farmers. Located about 48 kilometres from Granada city, the area is very popular with walkers, hiking parties and campers - because of the melting snow from the mountains above, the landscape is very green, the wild flowers grow abundantly and the mountain goats roam freely.</value>

  <data name="BuyerGuideFAQSintherory" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In theory it's easy. All you have to do is to go to the Extranjeros department of your nearest Policía Nacional station, fill in and sign an application form, and hand it in together with a recent passport sized photo. (N.B. When you get your photo done and if you wear glasses or earrings, take them off beforehand), a photocopy of your passport and your original passport. You must do this IN PERSON - you can't get anyone else to do it for you.</value>

    <value>Recent Spanish legislation makes it compulsory for anyone selling or buying property in Spain to have a NIE - Número de Identidad de Extranjeros which, translated, means "Identity Number for Foreigners". People applying for a NIE used to get a plastic card which fitted neatly into any wallet or purse, but the modern NIE is actually just a piece of paper with your name and number and a official stamp so, as friend of Euroresidentes Angus Wallace suggests, "remember to make about 20 photocopies of the original and keep those for everyday use, it's surprising how quickly that very important piece of paper becomes a mini jigsaw after it has been folded umpteen times and stuck in your wallet".</value>

    <value>Until recently, foreign non-residents in Spain could buy or sell property without a NIE. Then, once it became necessary to have one, their legal representative could get one for them.

  <data name="BuyerGuideUnpaidTaxesBuyerhimself" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The buyer is himself liable to retain the mentioned percentage from the purchase price and lodge it with the Taxman. The property remains liable for non-payment of the tax retention. In fact, the non-payment of these monies could even be construed as criminal misappropriation, although the taxman will simply wait until the time limits expire and will set in motion the administrative procedure to eventually sell at auction. Although many Lawyers do not check that this tax has been paid in previous sales of the property, it is highly advisable as your property could have been purchased and sold between non-residents more than once, and therefore there is the possibility that tax is owed.</value>

    <value>In principle, the buyer can sign with the supply company a fresh new contract and remain unaffected by the debts.

The notary does not check any terms, but certifies that both parties have agreed to the terms stated, (the notary is in place to only witness both parties' signatures). At this stage the property becomes your possession, and your Lawyer is now required to fax details of the title deed to the local land registry confirming you as the new owner.

You can either pay this by credit card, bank transfer, internet transfer or cash. Once you have paid the reservation deposit this guarantees that the property that you have chosen is taken off the market and is reserved for you at the agreed fixed price. At this stage you need to appoint a Lawyer who is fluent in Spanish, who can also speak your native language. Your Lawyer will explain the procedures involved with purchasing a property in Spain, as well as negotiating purchase terms with the vendor's Lawyer. It is normal at this stage to give power of attorney to your appointed Lawyer to act on your behalf. This will involve a visit to a public notary to sign over consent. At no time should power of attorney be given to the other party.</value>

    &lt;p&gt; Please note also that &lt;strong&gt;you need a NIE&lt;/strong&gt; to pay this tax. Any seller who is over 65 and has been a legal resident in Spain for the last three years does not have to pay this tax.

    &lt;h3&gt;What is the Plusval&amp;iacute;a Tax in Spain?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Plusval&amp;iacute;a Tax is a tax set by the local authorities and based on the increase of the value of the land from the date the owner acquired the property to the time of the present sale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The local authorities determine the amount of Plusval&amp;iacute;a to be paid for each house purchase in Spain, depending on the area where the property is located. The market value or sales price of the property does not have an effect on the Plusval&amp;iacute;a tax.      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally, but not necessarily, the seller pays the Plusval&amp;iacute;a tax. However, this will depend on the sales agreement. The tax is calculated according to the rateable value of the property and the number of years it has been in the ownership of the vendor. &lt;/p&gt;

If there is a very big difference between the price you are selling for and the price you originally paid, it might be worth applying for residency before you sell (nationals of EU member states are automatically granted residency, although the paperwork can be a bit tedious) in order to be eligible for the reduced percentage for residents.</value>

    <value>Heading east from Seville the countryside is vast and dominated by cereal crops and olive groves, but there are some delightful towns dotted across the landscape.</value>

  <data name="SevillaInfoinapril" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In April every year Seville hosts one of the largest parties in Spain, the "Feria de Abril" and people from all over Spain travel to take part in the festivities. The feria was originally just a cattle market, but through the years it has turned out to be one of the greatest popular festivals in Spain. It takes place just after the celebrations for Holy Week, Semana Santa, when some spectacular processions take place. There are over 1000 marquees, known as "casetas" at the feria site and every day at noon a procession called the "Paseo de Caballos" takes place. Girls in their traditional flamenco dresses are escorted through the city in carriages pulled by fine Spanish horses and in the late afternoon the bullfights begin and there is a terrific atmosphere of excitement and the whole city is buzzing!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfolacalle" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>La Calle Feria is one of the longest streets in Seville and is steeped in history. Its also a popular place for shoppers, having a whole range of retailers and also a street market every Thursday where you can buy just about everything!! There is also a public market for fresh produce.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfothearcitechure" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The architecture in Seville is magnificent and reflects centuries of culture by the variety of people who left their mark; romans, jews, arabs and gypsies. Inscribed long ago on the Jerez Gate are the words "Hercules built me; Caesar surrounded me with walls and towers; the King Saint took me". Take a visit to the Barrio Santa Cruz with its narrow streets and whitewashed houses which is home to many monuments and was once the Jewish quarter but is now known as the fashionable part of the city. Seville is particularly famous for its many tapas bars where you can enjoy some good company and some excellent food, maybe washed down with some of the locally produced fine sherry wines. The cuisine is likely to include specialities such as gazpacho, fresh fish fried in olive oil, chickpea stew, cured cod fish and bull's tail. Also worth trying are the butter cookies called "mantecados" or the sweets made from egg-yolks called "Yemas de San Leandro".</value>

  <data name="SevillaInfothecomerca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The comarca de la Sierra Norte is the only natural park in Seville and lots of oak and cork trees grow here. In the centre of the park is a beautiful picnic area. Las Cascadas del Huéznar are a must for visitors; these waterfalls are spectacular and are well signposted from in the park.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfotheplaza" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Plaza de España heading south from the city centre has a series of arches bearing crests of all the provinces of Spain and is surrounded by an artificial river, or the Parque de María Luisa which is open daily from dawn till dusk and is situated close to the plaza. Although situated in the centre of the city there are 400,000 m2 of woodland and two museums in the park.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfothepopular" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The popular capital of Andalucia, Seville, or Sevilla, is also the largest city in the province and the fourth largest in Spain; 40% of the province's population live here. It lies on the banks of the Guadalquivir river and is packed full of beautiful churches, monuments and the Cathedral which is the third largest Christian church in the world after St Peter's in Rome and St Paul's in London. If you climb to the top of La Giralda tower in the north-eastern corner of the cathedral you can experience breathtaking views of the city. Across the square from the cathedral is the Alcázar Palace which was the home of Spanish kings for nearly seven centuries. All of these landmarks help to make Seville one of the largest historical centres in Europe.</value>

  <data name="BuyersGuideMortageManyguide" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many guides about buying property in Spain assume that potential buyers actually have the money available, but if you are considering buying a house in Spain because you live and work here, or because you simply want to invest in real estate in Spain, you may want to consider taking out a mortgage with a Spanish Bank. Whether you want to buy a finca in Spain, a holiday apartment or a new home in Spain, taking out a Spanish mortgage may be the right solution for you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="BuyersGuideMortagemostspanish" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most Spanish banks currently offer mortgages of 60-70% property price over 5, 10, 15 or 20 years depending on whether you are a resident here or not. The current variable rate is about 6% and there is usually an early write-off fee of around 1.5%.</value>

    <value>But it's not all olives, far from it. The centrepiece of the area is its Natural Park, the Sierras Subbética, some 31,000 hectares of medium-height limestone mountains which extend through much of the region, their steep slopes and rugged crags overlooking pretty, narrow valleys. Although not especially high, it does boast Córdoba's highest peak, La Tiñosa at 1,570 metres. The beautiful olive trees cover the vast landscapes in Andalucia. Why not buy your own finca with olive trees?</value>

    <value>La Subbética de Córdoba lies in the very centre of Andalucía, almost equidistant from its major towns, Córdoba itself, Granada, Sevilla and Málaga. Within an hour from here you can be in any one of these great cities.</value>

  <data name="InlandAndaluciaregion" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Andalucía is the region of Spain that attracts most tourism. Its good weather and unique history make it a perfect destination for short or long visits alike. Andalucía is composed of eight provinces:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="InlandAndaluciathesesierras" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These sierras are a joy to behold, and well worth the trouble of getting out of the car and exploring on foot. Forested with oaks and maples, they are home to wild cats and boar, foxes and hedgehogs - not to mention the Cabrera shrew. Eagles, falcons, vultures and kestrels circle the skies high above; cuckoos, partridges, owls and swifts compete for the lower air space. Butterflies flutter through a pastoral scene of pure delight. It's not without interest underground, either, with some wonderful cave formations, the work of rivers flowing through the limestone fissures.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="InlandAndaluciawithclimate" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With a climate which is typically Andalusian which is hot in summer, mild in spring and autumn, a little chilly in the depths of winter, inland Andalucia, including La Subbética de Córdoba, offers so much to the visitor: authentic Andaluz lifestyle, a rich cultural tapestry, beautiful countryside, attractive towns and villages - and an easy journey to each and every one of Andalucía's great historic cities as well as Malaga's airport, which is only an hour away from most of the towns we cover.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LocationMapInlandautonomous" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The autonomous region of Andalucia lies in the the south of Spain, and its coasts are bathed by both the Mediterranean and Atlantic oceans.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LocationMapInlandborders" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It borders Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha in the north, Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea in the east, the Mediterranean and Atlantic ocean in the south, and Portugal in the west. The region's scenery stands out because of its sheer diversity. Some areas are covered in mountains while others are full of plains. There are three distinct geographical structures: the sierra Morena to the north, the Guadalquivir river and Betica depression in the central part of the region, and the Betica mountain ranges in the south.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LocationMapInlandmostnotable" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The two most notable mountainous areas are the sub-Betica range, containing La Sagra massif that reaches an altitude of 2,383 metres and the Penibetica mountain range. The Sierra Nevada is also outstanding and is home to el Mulhacen, the highest mountain peak on the Iberian Peninsula reaching a height of 3,481 metres. Next comes Veleta peak at 3,392 metres. Andalucian rivers that lead into the Mediterranean sea are relatively short and contain small amounts of water. Amongst these are the Almanzora, the Almeria, the Adra, the Guadalfeo, the Guadalhore and the Guadiaro. The rivers that flow into the Atlantic are bigger and have more copious waters. The region's most important river is the Guadalquivir and its tributaries: the Guadalimar, the Guadiana Menor and the Genil. The Guadiana, the Odiel and the Tinto rivers also flow into the Atlantic.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LocationMapInlandvaststrech" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The vast stretch of coast that extends along Andalucia is filled with bays and inlets, some a little more craggy than others as we near the Betica mountain ranges. The most notable geographical quirks that are found along the coast include: the steep rock summit of Farallon, Polacra point, Gata cape, the gulf of Almeria, las Entinas point, Adra bay, Sacratif bay, Malaga bay and Calaburras point. Europa Point forms the Gibraltar headland. This is where the Spanish coast begins stretching from the straits of Gibraltar up to the cape of Trafalgar. Within the straits the most notable parts of the landscape are formed by Algeciras bay as well as by Marroqui (Moroccan) and Tarifa points.</value>

    <value>Estepa, an ancient town of 14,000 24km east of Osuna in the province of Sevilla, is famous for its renowned biscuits known as mantecados and polvorones which its bakers make each Christmas and which are eaten across this region of Andalucia.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="EstepaDetail1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Romans re-populated the town from their settlements elsewhere in the region and called it Ostipo, although they themselves were ejected by Visigoths from the Baltic regions four centuries later. In the eighth century, the Moorish armies who had invaded the south-western tip of the region in 711 CE took the town and renamed it Istabba.</value>

    <value>The archaeological museum, the Museo Padre Martín Recio (calle Ancha 14), has a collection of local finds dating back to the Paleolithic period, and religious artefacts from Roman, Visigothic, Arabic and later cultures, including an intriguing Roman 'hypnos', or statue of the god of sleep.</value>

  <data name="EstepaDetail11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The building itself was built in 1636 as a school, was converted into a prison in 1702 and in the early 20th century reverted to a school run by a local religious order. We wonder what the pupils thought of its history?</value>

  <data name="EstepaDetail12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The central Plaza El Carmen was as the name suggests built in honour of the Virgin Carmen. It was expanded in 1745 to accommodate a plaza de toros, bullring.

    <value>The city walls that still surrounding the old town on the San Cristobal hill were first built in the 10th century by the Moors, renovated by Almohad invaders in the 12th, and again reconstructed when Estepa fell to the Christian Order of Santiago in the 13th. The keep inside the walls was built against attacks from Granada in the 14th century, and at 26 metres at its highest offers sweeping views of the town and surrounding countryside.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="EstepaDetail15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The old town also conceals a number of notable religious buildings. Franciscan monks built a convent in the north-east corner of the hill in 1603, and the convent, its church and house of novitiates still stand. The proto-Baroque façade of the church features a single body with a round arch and pediment split with pinnacles. The tower is 22m high and topped by an impressive belfry and spire.</value>

    <value>In between the squares of San Sebastian and Nuestro Padre Jesús is a small hermitage dedicated to Saint Sebastian, rebuilt in 1568 by Genoese architect Vicente Boyol. The present church has doors into both squares, Renaissance in style, but flanked by hefty Gothic buttresses.</value>

    <value>Estepa smells like a cake factory in the run-up to Christmas, as local bakers and even home cooks work to meet the demand for its favourite icing-covered polvorone biscuits.

    <value>The Arabs renovated an abandoned pre-Roman castle at the top of the San Cristobal hill on which the town sits, and began fortifying it against the incursions during the Reconquest. Shifts in power between various caliphates saw it fall under the control of various caliphs, including the kingdoms of both Granada and Sevilla. The renowned poet Al Zawwali lived here before returning to Marrakech in 1220 shortly before his death.</value>

Estepa Andalucia bandolerosMost notorious was José Maria Hinojosa Cabacho, 'El Tempranillo', who once issued what was in effect a press statement saying that while the King may well rule Spain, he, Tempranillo, ruled the mountains.

  <data name="CarcabuerDetail3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The castle itself has gone down in history for a battle between King Alfonso X and his rival Sancho. As the story goes, the King had ordered everyone to stay inside the castle no matter what. His rival knew that in order to emerge victorious over the local population he needed to get the army out onto open ground. He learned that the governer's daughter had a "secret" lover and therefore devised a plan to lure her away from the castle to meet her true love and escape together. In this way, he was sure the governer would call out the troops to go after the girl and bring her back.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CarcabuerDetail4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The governer, a man named Pero Nuño Tello, was committed to total loyalty to his king. He therefore refused to send out the troops thus losing his daughter forever as she fled with her lover.</value>

  <data name="CarcabuerDetail5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Interestingly, when Sancho later became King, he was sorry for the injury he had caused to the governer and he called Pero to his court to make amends. However, he was only able to meet with Pero's dead body as the governer committed suicide in order to present the King with the only loyal part of himself (his dead body) he could offer. His spirit, as the legend goes, would never bow to Sancho.</value>

The first inhabitants of Encinas Reales Lucena farmers who came to work the fields of the Dukes of Medinaceli so that the residents of the new village would not have to go Lucena to meet the Holy Mother Church. Works on the town must have been slow, because it was not completed until 1814, almost two centuries after the start. The ancient oaks were places, hence the name, but the original was Encinas sparse, which suggests that these trees were widely spaced or sparse. The reason for this aspect so spread is due to the continuous logging of these nuclei of oaks during the wars of Christians against Muslims in the region of Granada. Over time the town achieved Royal status, which gives the town more rank and importance and which relates a legend about how Doña Isabella, going on a trip, rested in the shade of some large oaks that were there.</value>

  <data name="FuentetojarDetail1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is located at an altitude of 600 meters and 86 kilometres from the provincial capital, Córdoba. There is evidence of an ancient human presence in this town; the most important archaeological site are the remains of the once Iberian-Roman city. A must to visit in the Cerro de Las Cabezas and whose remains are in the Municipal History Museum. Also of interest in the surroundings is the existence of a pool and a large pool in the area known as Los Corralones. The interior was a refuge during the Civil War of 1939.</value>

    <value>Once in the center of the village, after learning of the Museum, a must visit to the parish church of Our Lady of the Rosary, the eighteenth century church with beautiful Baroque works inside. Also interesting is the chapel of Calvary and finally an overview of the whole town and countyside of subbética from the viewpoint that we find at the top of the town. There are places where you can make several hiking trails around the Cerro de Las Cabezas. Furthermore, this municipality is part of the tourist route oil, Baroque art, archeology and nature. In its cuisine virgin olive oil is essential to make dishes such as bean soup with mayonnaise, soup dumplings, fried donuts or traditional Easter stew. Emphasize also carnival stuffed sausage prepared with pork stomach in this festival.</value>

    <value>Iznajar itself escaped the submersion that often visits towns and villages in the region of Andalucia's controversial programme to construct more and more dams and reservoirs to serve this increasingly thirsty region. If anything, the lake below has given further resonance to its unofficial title as the Mirador (viewpoint) del Genil. Surrounding countryside and communications have been radically altered, not least by a bridge built across the reservoir near Iznajar in order to continue to carry traffic on the Archidona/Priego de Córdoba road. In effect, Iznajar now offers the perfect setting for anyone wanting to live in the (cheaper) interior but still retain a 'sea' view.</value>

  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This Village of 5,500 inhabitant's lies north-west of Alameda is probably most famous for its cadaverous celebrity El Tempranillo, the legendary 19th century bandit born in nearby Jauja and buried in Alameda's Iglesía de la Purísima Concepción church. The so-called Principe de la Sierra, prince of the mountains, is the most colourful of Andalucía's many bandit heroes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alameda was first settled as a town by the Phoenicians, but there is archaeological evidence of habitation dating back to Paleolithic and Neolithic times, probably 2-2,500 BCE. Vestiges of these settlements can be seen at the Necrópolis Calcolítica just outside the town, a system of over twenty interconnected burial pits or ossuaries, some a metre wide.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alameda was also an important settlement in Roman times, with the remains of a Roman villa and baths and a wealth of artefacts discovered suggesting a major trade and military base at the site in the first century BC. The remains of the baths are maintained in a 3000 square metre enclosure in Calle Enmedio, and have been dated to between the first and third centuries AC. The site is now a preserved national monument.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Like much of the region, it was overrun by Visigoth invaders and later by Moorish settlers in the eighth century. The Catholic reconquistadores took the town in 1240, relatively early in the Reconquest, and when the new Spanish order was established the town, then a small hamlet, was placed under the control of the Marqués of Alameda, to the north-west of the town. The region itself was under the rule of the Order of Santiago - the Knights of St James - until 1559, a time when Alameda had barely thirty inhabitants.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The town grew during the 17th century, thanks to its specialisation in esparto grass, wood and carpentry (one version of the origin of its name is from a poplar grove), and an influx of settlers from Alameda itself.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In 1883 Alameda was incorporated into the newly created province of Málaga, under the control of Archidona. This was an unpopular and confusing decision in a village that was still under the orders of both the bishop of Alameda and the archbishop of Seville. The town was only placed under the orders of the archbishop Álaga as late as 1959.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The baroque Iglesía de la Purísima Concepción was built in 1696, the church tower being a later addition, along with the remarkable rococo altar piece at the head of the nave. The church was actually expanded sideways in 1779 with two new aisles, supported by eight massive pillars, to accommodate the town's burgeoning new population. The tomb of El Tempranillo can be seen in the church's interior patio.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The main focus of Alameda is the central Fuente de la Placeta, built from delicate local stone at the time of King Carlos III, in the Plaza de España. Until recent decades it was still the main source of fresh water for the town, and the sizeable width of the fountain's base, built perhaps deliberately, made it impossible to fill a large pitcher without leaning over and falling into the fountain. Townsfolk developed a trick of putting the pitcher on the ground and filling it using a hollow cane reed. The nearby Plaza de la Constitution is a pleasant tree-lined square with benches where townspeople take their evening paseo, walk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just outside town, the Mirador de la Camorra offers excellent views over the town and surrounding landscape, some 250 metres higher than Alameda's 430 metres above sea level. There's an easy path to the top. A couple of kilometres west of town is the Laguna de la Ratosa, like the nearby Fuente de Piedra a place to find flamingos and other migrating birds and an abundance of other wildlife.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AlamedaLocationDetail9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alameda's key festivals are its February Candelaria procession, the three-day celebrations for its patron saint, San Isidro Labrador, on 15-18 March, and the August feria, held in the first week of the month. The town still specialises in its work with esparto grass, wood and carpentry, in particular silleria, the production of wood seats.</value>

  <data name="ArchidonaLocationDetail4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Archidona dates back to prehistoric times, as proven by important archaeological findings pertaining to the Palaeolithic period. The first major settlers in the area were the túrdulos. The Phoenicians began the construction of the village walls.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ArchidonaLocationDetail5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The village was an important strategic location for the Carthaginians. They reinforced the walls and it was crucial in the war against the Romans. During the Roman era, it was known as Arx Domina, the Arabs modified this to Arxiduna, which is the origin of its present-day name.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ArchidonaLocationDetail6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Moslem occupation consisted of several stages. Following the proclamation of Abderraman I as emir of Cordoba in 756, Archidona, a dependency of the aforementioned city, became the capital of the cora (region) of Rayya (an area which, roughly speaking, coincided with the modern-day province of Malaga). It was in the thick of the muladi (Christian convert to Islam) rebellion of the late 9th and early 10th centuries, led by Ben Hafsun, who turned it into a fortified town.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ArchidonaLocationDetail7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In 907, it was conquered again, this time by the emir Abd Allah. And, when Bobastro, a fortress at the centre of Omar Ben Hafsun's rebellion, fell into the hands of Abderraman III in 928, it was the start of a period of great prosperity for the region, in which commerce, industry and agriculture blossomed. However, this period of splendour ended with the political and economic division which accompanied the era known as the Taifa Kingdom period; by the end of the 11th century, the village's lands were abandoned and impoverished.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ArchidonaLocationDetail8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In 1238 it became a dependency of the Nazari Kingdom of Granada, and Archidona experienced its second boom, this time due largely to the silk trade. Before long, however, a new turn of events shattered the commercial links of the whole region: the 14th century saw the start of the Christian campaigns in the area, which became a border zone, its territory suffering frequent pillaging. It was finally captured in 1462 by Don Pedro de Giron, Grand Master of Calatrava.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ArchidonaLocationDetail9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Archidona's present-day location dates back to the 16th century, when construction began on the are known as Villa Baja. The village's long and eventful history, coupled with the desire of its inhabitants to preserve the artistic heritage born of the key role played by the village down the years, has resulted in Archidona being declared a Village of Historical and Artistic Importance.</value>

  <data name="CampillosLocationDetail" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This peaceful little town in the province of Málaga of less than 8000 inhabitants, equidistant between the Costa del Sol, Granada and Sevilla, has been an important cattle farming, leather production and mining centre since Roman times. Archaeological digs in the vicinity have uncovered Roman architecture and coins, as well as brass busts of Octavius, Claudius, Constantine and Trajan. Nowadays, however, it is mainly known as one of the key stops on the Algeciras-Granada rail line.</value>

    <value>Drivers, who will reach it 30km from Alameda on the N342 which continues on to Olvera, Arcos de la Frontera and Jerez de la Frontera, will also find it a worthwhile diversion to see the flocks of brilliant pink flamingos that, in season, nest in the nearby La Fuente de la Piedra ('fountain of stone') waterlands. Like much of Andalucía, its post-Roman history followed the familiar pattern of Visigothic and Arabic invasion. It fell to the Christian forces relatively early in the Reconquest, in 1324, when the town was almost totally destroyed. It was considered sufficiently important to both Arabs and Christians to have been the subject of several fierce battles, notably in 1237 between the army of Mohamed Alhamar, Moorish king of Granada, and rebels from Campillos and nearby Loja. After the fall of Granada in 1492, it was rebuilt and resettled by farmers and coal workers from Osuna and Teba.</value>

  <data name="CampillosLocationDetail2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The most important monument in Campillos is its central Iglesia Parroquial Nuestra Señora del Reposo, the parish church of our lady of rest, which is just off the town's plaza central. The impressive bell tower was built by Fray (father) Miguel de Santísimo Sacramento in the 16th century. Its chief architectural style is Doric, with two stone facades, one Doric, the other baroque. The main altar in the church features a pine tabernacle with eight columns 'jónicas', that is, of the Ionian or Ionic school of architecture, with the familiar fluted columns and elaborate capitals of classical Greek architecture.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="martosdetail2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It has a population of 24063 inhabitants, making Martos the fifth largest municipality in the province. The city is located on a western peak of the Sierra Jabalcuz mountain range. It belongs to the metropolitan Area of Jaén, of which it is considered to be the second most important city after the capital.

  <data name="martosdetail4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Its economy is based on agriculture, in particular the cultivation of the olive tree. Martos is considered to be the first producer of olive oil of the world. Also important are various industries, especially those related to the treatment of plastic. The city has been linked to the Roman settlement of Colonia Augusta Gemella, and starting in the 8th century was ruled by the Moors under various Islamic states for over 500 years. In 1225, King Ferdinand III of Castile and Leon captured the city from the Moors and incorporated it into his kingdom.</value>

    <value>At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Martos underwent significant economic and urban development (reflected in the city's architecture), in large part due to the wealth derived from the industrial production of olive oil. Martos thus became one of the most prosperous cities of eastern Andalusia.</value>

  <data name="MollinaLocationDetail" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There has been a human settlement on the site of this small town (current population just over 4,800) since Neolithic times. Just 15km north-west of Antequera on the A92, on the lower slopes of the Sierra de Mollina, this is set in perfect olive and cereal country. It is also a mere ten km from the Laguna de Fuente de la Piedra lake, famous for its pink flamingos.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MollinaLocationDetail1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The name derives in fact from a milling tower, the Torre Mollina (similar to the Costa's Torremolinos), which vanished some time in the Middle Ages. An alternative theory claims the name originates with its Roman rulers and derives from the Latin 'mollis', suave, or bland.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MollinaLocationDetail2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Little remains of either Neolithic or Roman Mollina, beyond some Neolithic artefacts found in the neighbouring Sierra de la Camorra, and, seven km from Mollina itself, the rectangular shaped Roman mausoleum of La Capuchina.</value>

    <value>Four km outside town there are the ruins of the fort of Castellum of Santillán, originally a settlement built around a Roman villa and surrounding outbuildings covering an area of 1400 square metres. The Castellum was later reinforced with defensive walls, a sign of the upheavals in this part of Andalucia in Roman times.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MollinaLocationDetail4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The present town, however, dates mainly from a more peaceful time, the 16th century, when the Reconquest was won and the lands parcelled out for farming to the victors. Thus the peacetime Mollina grew up around a convent, the Convent de la Ascension, rather than a fortified encampment like many Andalucian towns. (Don't miss the handsome sundial on the covent façade.) At its agricultural peak, Mollina's olive groves were so productive that the parish church of San Cayetano, built in 1687, was changed to Nuestra Señora de la Oliva.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MollinaLocationDetail5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mollina won independence from nearby Antequera at the beginning of the 19th century, although at that time Andalucia's agriculture was in decline. Since the 1960s, the population has dwindled as the young head to the coast to work. Yet Mollina still produces a surprising 80 per cent of the wine made in the province of Málaga.</value>

    <value>Mollina has four major annual festivals. The Candelaria, or candle-lit procession, is celebrated on the first day of February, and in May there is a Romería, or procession into the country, in honour of the Virgen de la Oliva. The town's summer feria is early, in the second week of August, but that is perhaps to make way for possibly the most important festival, the wine harvest festival, or Feria de la Vendimia, in the second week of September.</value>

  <data name="carmonaCarmona" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carmona is a fascinating town and well worth a visit, whether you are a history buff or not. From Carmona is a 28km-long greenway to Alcalá de Guadaíra, the Vía Verde of the Hills, which you can go on foot, bike or horseback.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="carmonaclose" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Close by to the east is Santa Maria, a stately Gothic church built over the former main mosque, whose elegant patio is retained. Like many of Carmona's churches, it is topped by an evocative Mudejar tower and part of the original minaret may still be spotted. Dominating the ridge of the town are the massive ruins of Pedro's palace, destroyed by an earthquake in 1504 and now taken over by a gracious if expensive parador.</value>

&lt;div class="img-blog"&gt;&lt;img src="../BlogImages/newinland.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as many other dishes from various parts of the world, paella evolved from &amp;nbsp;local produce. It is estimated that its preparation began between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the inhabitants of some of the rural areas of Valencia started to mix the different ingredients they had available to make a fast and easy meal for the farmers and shepherds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In principle, they added fresh vegetables to rice with chicken and rabbit, as well as saffron and olive oil, ingredients that gave it its characteristic flavour of the Mediterranean. As paella became more popular, seafood and shellfish were added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119p1"&gt;&lt;span class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119s1"&gt;There are many stories that revolve around this mythical Spanish recipe, one of them tells that it is a dish that was usually consumed in the evenings. Another legend, dating to the Spanish War of Independence, relates that a French general, impressed by the exquisite taste of paella, told a woman that "for each new plate of rice cooked he would free a Spanish prisoner." In the end, the military had to release 176 prisoners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119p1"&gt;&lt;span class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119s1"&gt;The exact origin of paella, pride of any Valencian, is located in the rice area near the lake of Albufera.&amp;nbsp; Olive oil and saffron, essential ingredients for its preparation were added to the original recipe. Similarly, the farmers of the time, in addition to the meat and vegetables they had on hand, incorporated tavella and ferraura (two native types of green beans) and garrof&amp;oacute; (a flat and white bean), as well as paprika, rosemary and snails.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="blog-sub-hd"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is it called paella?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="blog-main-txt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The shape of this pan should be a minimum diameter of 30 centimeters, with edges of 7 to 12 centimeters, not very deep, with two handles fixed to the sides that support the stew and allow it to be transported easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119p1"&gt;&lt;span class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119s1"&gt;For an authentic Valencian paella, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Valencian Government has decreed that ten ingredients must be included, &amp;nbsp;chicken, rabbit, basil (green bean), garrofon, tomato, rice, olive oil, water, saffron and salt.&amp;nbsp; However, garlic, artichoke, duck, paprika, snails or rosemary can also be added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119p1"&gt;&lt;span class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119s1"&gt;Over time,&amp;nbsp;other variations have been created of which&amp;nbsp;"paella marinera" is the most popular and accepted. In this one vegetables and meat are replaced by diverse seafood, molluscs and fish. (In addition to supplying the water for fish stock - not sure about this bit!).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119p1"&gt;&lt;span class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119s1"&gt;Another type of paella is "mixed" in which, as it's name suggests &amp;nbsp;meat, chicken or rabbit is mixed with seafood. This recipe is rarely consumed in Valencia but will be found in most non-Valencian or foreign restaurants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119p1"&gt;&lt;span class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119s1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Paella alicantina" &amp;nbsp;is made from a broth, which contains fish (sepia, prawns and swordfish) and meat (chicken or rabbit). Its elaboration originates from the south of Valencia, especially in the counties of l'Alacant&amp;iacute;-Alcoi&amp;agrave; or the Foia of Castalla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119p1"&gt;&lt;span class="m_-4573994574725298096m_-2849109210885379119s1"&gt;Paella became famous first in Spain, and began to spread to other cultures and countries such as Belgium and France after the nineteenth century.&amp;nbsp; Its rise in most continents was mainly due to being a festive dish that became common in family gatherings, and was born to gather people together and to celebrate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
