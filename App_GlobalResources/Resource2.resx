    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  </data>
  <data name="TownLocationInfohunderedof" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With so many hundreds of white washed villages in Andalucia it's difficult to know which the right one for you. We always suggest that before you start looking for a home, you should spend some time looking for an area. Here in Spain you will spend considerably more time outdoors so it's essential that your environment and surroundings are comfortable. Buy the area first and then you're home!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TownLocationInfosmallvillage" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The small villages in the Antequera, Estepa and Marchena area have all the amenities you'll need but you may need to ask around in the beginning as most shops are run from the ground floor of the proprietor's house and seldom have a sign! A larger town is always nearby for high street shopping and other services.</value>

  <data name="CordobaInfoAcross" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Across the river from the Mezquita is the Alcázar (or fortress) which was built by the Christians in 1328 as a defence against the Muslims. It offers a lovely respite from the summer heat as you wander through the tree shaded gardens and courtyards.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CordobaInfoAsyoumind" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As you wind your way south there are some beautiful whitewashed villages where a friendly welcome can always be found... Puente Genil, Benamejí, Encinas Reales and, of course, Iznajar which is popular for the lake and its beach, and not forgetting La Subbetica natural park which was designated such in 1988 and is home to a miriad of birds, flowers and fauna.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CordobaInfoCity" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As the city is divided, so is the province: The Sierra Morena in the north with its rugged pine and oak covered hills with a few steep villages set into them. The Campiña in the south which are the farmlands covered in wheat, vine and olive trees. The area is famous for its dry white wines, similar to sherry, which are produced from the Pedro Ximenez grape and olive oil, which is the other main produce from the region. This is why olive oil is an important ingredient of many typical dishes, Gazpacho and Salmorejo are cold soups made mainly of mashed vegetables and olive oil and are delicious and refreshing in the heat of the summer. Jamon, which is cured ham, Salchichon, a typical sausage, Caña de Lomo and Morcilla, black pudding are also widely enjoyed in the province. Some typical desserts are Alfajores, made of almonds and honey and Pestiños, which is fried in oil and then coverd with honey.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CordobaInfoCordobaenjoys" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cordoba enjoys its fiestas and festivals the same as every other town in Spain, and Semana Santa, or Easter week is one of the most important. There are no fewer than 32 processions in total with beautifully decorated and ornate pictures and figures of Saints accompanied by the Nazarenos (men dressed in typical gowns with hoods that cover all the face except the eyes). These processions pass through the town followed by crowds of people. In May there are three festivals; from 5th to 12th there is the Festival of the "Patios Cordobeses", a contest for the most beautifully decorated courtyard; the Cruces de Mayo is when the whole town is decorated with crosses and thousands of flowers; the last week in May is when everyone lets their hair down at the Feria de Cordoba - flamenco music and dance are enjoyed and the whole town revels in the festivities.</value>

  <data name="CordobaInfoJewishQuarter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The "Jewish Quarter" or old town, with its small plazas, patios full of colourful flowers and typical bars where tapas are enjoyed, is full of amazing architecture. The Mezquita (or mosque) attracts thousands of visitors each year who flock to admire the magnificent workmanship - it took two centuries to complete and is an amazing jungle of columns, recesses and arches with a church at its centre. Outside the mosque are the beautiful gardens, "the Patio de los Naranjos" and the "Calleja de la Flores".</value>

    <value>Another town which was built as a defence on the western edge of the province is the beautiful town of Loja which spans the Genil river and is surrounding by olive groves and crops. You can still see the evidence of this stronghold today in the ruins of walls and the tower which was once part of the fortress.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfocityof" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The city of Granada was originally known as Ilbyr in prehistoric times when it was inhabited by native tribes and then when the Romans colonised southern Spain they built their own city and it was called Illibris. The present name of Granada came from the Arabs who invaded in the 8th century.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfoheading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Heading west from Granada are some lovely villages, usually at the top of hills where they were built as Moorish defences against the Christians. One of them, close to the Córdoba border, is the stunning town of Montefrio with one of its churches (Iglesia de la Villa) perched on top of a rocky pinnacle. The views from the church are magnificent and, although the church no longer holds services, you can visit the small museum inside and learn all about the church and the castle that stood in its place before its demolition in 1486.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfojustshort" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just a short drive outside Loja, on the river, are several waterfalls which are now a designated protected area. The river is a popular place for fishermen who travel from all over southern Spain to try their hand at catching one of the massive trout that frequent the Rio Genil.</value>

  <data name="GranadaInfoprovience" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>GRANADA Province is situated in the eastern part of the autonomous region of Andalucia, is bordered by the provinces of Málaga, Córdoba, Jaén, Albacete, Murcia, Almería and stretches down to the Mediterranean sea. It's total area is 12,635km2 and contains 168 municipalities.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfoprovienceboasts" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Granada province boasts the tallest mountain in continental Spain, Mulhacén, at 3,481 metres as well as the Sierra Nevada mountain range (the most southerly ski resort in Europe). During the winter months, tourists flock to the Sierra Nevada for the skiing and mountain climbing, but Granada city is popular the year round for its Moorish architecture and the famous Alhambra, with its palaces and gardens. Not forgetting the cave dwellings dotted about the Sacromonte hill to the north of the city which was once the home of Granada's large gypsy community.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfothehill" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The hill facing the Alhambra is called the Albaicin and if you wind your way up through the narrow streets, past all the whitewashed houses, you will reach the highest point with amazing views of the Alhambra and the many differing landscapes of Granada province.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GranadaInfotheserieaa" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Sierra Nevada was designated a natural park in 1989 and a national park in 1998 and is shared by Granada and Almería provinces. The Alpujarras, the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, are well known for the distinctive Berber architecture of whitish grey box-shaped houses with flat clay roofs and the unique irrigation aqueducts that are still in use by local farmers. Located about 48 kilometres from Granada city, the area is very popular with walkers, hiking parties and campers - because of the melting snow from the mountains above, the landscape is very green, the wild flowers grow abundantly and the mountain goats roam freely.</value>

  <data name="BuyerGuideFAQSintherory" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In theory it's easy. All you have to do is to go to the Extranjeros department of your nearest Policía Nacional station, fill in and sign an application form, and hand it in together with a recent passport sized photo. (N.B. When you get your photo done and if you wear glasses or earrings, take them off beforehand), a photocopy of your passport and your original passport.

    <value>Recent Spanish legislation makes it compulsory for anyone selling or buying property in Spain to have a NIE - Número de Identidad de Extranjeros which, translated, means "Identity Number for Foreigners". People applying for a NIE used to get a plastic card which fitted neatly into any wallet or purse, but the modern NIE is actually just a piece of paper with your name and number and a official stamp so, as friend of Euroresidentes Angus Wallace suggests, "remember to make about 20 photocopies of the original and keep those for everyday use, it's surprising how quickly that very important piece of paper becomes a mini jigsaw after it has been folded umpteen times and stuck in your wallet".</value>

    <value>Until recently, foreign non-residents in Spain could buy or sell property without a NIE. Then, once it became necessary to have one, their legal representative could get one for them.

    <value>The buyer is himself liable to retain the mentioned percentage from the purchase price and lodge it with the Taxman. The property remains liable for non-payment of the tax retention. In fact, the non-payment of these monies could even be construed as criminal misappropriation, although the taxman will simply wait until the time limits expire and will set in motion the administrative procedure to eventually sell at auction. Although many Lawyers do not check that this tax has been paid in previous sales of the property, it is highly advisable as your property could have been purchased and sold between non-residents more than once, and therefore there is the possibility that tax is owed.</value>

    <value>In principle, the buyer can sign with the supply company a fresh new contract and remain unaffected by the debts.

The notary does not check any terms, but certifies that both parties have agreed to the terms stated, (the notary is in place to only witness both parties' signatures). At this stage the property becomes your possession, and your Lawyer is now required to fax details of the title deed to the local land registry confirming you as the new owner.

You can either pay this by credit card, bank transfer, internet transfer or cash. Once you have paid the reservation deposit this guarantees that the property that you have chosen is taken off the market and is reserved for you at the agreed fixed price. At this stage you need to appoint a Lawyer who is fluent in Spanish, who can also speak your native language. Your Lawyer will explain the procedures involved with purchasing a property in Spain, as well as negotiating purchase terms with the vendor's Lawyer. It is normal at this stage to give power of attorney to your appointed Lawyer to act on your behalf. This will involve a visit to a public notary to sign over consent. At no time should power of attorney be given to the other party.</value>

    &lt;p&gt; Please note also that &lt;strong&gt;you need a NIE&lt;/strong&gt; to pay this tax. Any seller who is over 65 and has been a legal resident in Spain for the last three years does not have to pay this tax.

    &lt;p&gt; The local authorities determine the amount of Plusval&amp;iacute;a to be paid for each house purchase in Spain, depending on the area where the property is located. The market value or sales price of the property does not have an effect on the Plusval&amp;iacute;a tax.      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally, but not necessarily, the seller pays the Plusval&amp;iacute;a tax. However, this will depend on the sales agreement. The tax is calculated according to the rateable value of the property and the number of years it has been in the ownership of the vendor. &lt;/p&gt;

This means that property sellers not living in Spain will have to arrange for their Lawyer to see to the necessary paperwork and to formalise the tax payment about a month after the sale. If there is a very big difference between the price you are selling for and the price you originally paid, it might be worth applying for residency before you sell (nationals of EU member states are automatically granted residency, although the paperwork can be a bit tedious) in order to be eligible for the reduced percentage for residents.</value>

    <value>Heading east from Seville the countryside is vast and dominated by cereal crops and olive groves, but there are some delightful towns dotted across the landscape.</value>

  <data name="SevillaInfoinapril" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In April every year Seville hosts one of the largest parties in Spain, the "Feria de Abril" and people from all over Spain travel to take part in the festivities. The feria was originally just a cattle market, but through the years it has turned out to be one of the greatest popular festivals in Spain. It takes place just after the celebrations for Holy Week, Semana Santa, when some spectacular processions take place. There are over 1000 marquees, known as "casetas" at the feria site and every day at noon a procession called the "Paseo de Caballos" takes place. Girls in their traditional flamenco dresses are escorted through the city in carriages pulled by fine Spanish horses and in the late afternoon the bullfights begin and there is a terrific atmosphere of excitement and the whole city is buzzing!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfolacalle" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>La Calle Feria is one of the longest streets in Seville and is steeped in history. Its also a popular place for shoppers, having a whole range of retailers and also a street market every Thursday where you can buy just about everything!! There is also a public market for fresh produce.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfothearcitechure" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The architecture in Seville is magnificent and reflects centuries of culture by the variety of people who left their mark; romans, jews, arabs and gypsies. Inscribed long ago on the Jerez Gate are the words "Hercules built me; Caesar surrounded me with walls and towers; the King Saint took me". Take a visit to the Barrio Santa Cruz with its narrow streets and whitewashed houses which is home to many monuments and was once the Jewish quarter but is now known as the fashionable part of the city. Seville is particularly famous for its many tapas bars where you can enjoy some good company and some excellent food, maybe washed down with some of the locally produced fine sherry wines. The cuisine is likely to include specialities such as gazpacho, fresh fish fried in olive oil, chickpea stew, cured cod fish and bull's tail. Also worth trying are the butter cookies called "mantecados" or the sweets made from egg-yolks called "Yemas de San Leandro".</value>

  <data name="SevillaInfothecomerca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The comarca de la Sierra Norte is the only natural park in Seville and lots of oak and cork trees grow here. In the centre of the park is a beautiful picnic area. Las Cascadas del Huéznar are a must for visitors; these waterfalls are spectacular and are well signposted from in the park.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfotheplaza" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Plaza de España heading south from the city centre has a series of arches bearing crests of all the provinces of Spain and is surrounded by an artificial river, or the Parque de María Luisa which is open daily from dawn till dusk and is situated close to the plaza. Although situated in the centre of the city there are 400,000 m2 of woodland and two museums in the park.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SevillaInfothepopular" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The popular capital of Andalucia, Seville, or Sevilla, is also the largest city in the province and the fourth largest in Spain; 40% of the province's population live here. It lies on the banks of the Guadalquivir river and is packed full of beautiful churches, monuments and the Cathedral which is the third largest Christian church in the world after St Peter's in Rome and St Paul's in London. If you climb to the top of La Giralda tower in the north-eastern corner of the cathedral you can experience breathtaking views of the city. Across the square from the cathedral is the Alcázar Palace which was the home of Spanish kings for nearly seven centuries. All of these landmarks help to make Seville one of the largest historical centres in Europe.</value>

  <data name="BuyersGuideMortageManyguide" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many guides about buying property in Spain assume that potential buyers actually have the money available, but if you are considering buying a house in Spain because you live and work here, or because you simply want to invest in real estate in Spain, you may want to consider taking out a mortgage with a Spanish Bank. Whether you want to buy a finca in Spain, a holiday apartment or a new home in Spain, taking out a Spanish mortgage may be the right solution for you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="BuyersGuideMortagemostspanish" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most Spanish banks currently offer mortgages of 60-70% property price over 5, 10, 15 or 20 years depending on whether you are a resident here or not. The current variable rate is about 6% and there is usually an early write-off fee of around 1.5%.</value>

    <value>But it's not all olives, far from it. The centrepiece of the area is its Natural Park, the Sierras Subbética, some 31,000 hectares of medium-height limestone mountains which extend through much of the region, their steep slopes and rugged crags overlooking pretty, narrow valleys. Although not especially high, it does boast Córdoba's highest peak, La Tiñosa at 1,570 metres. The beautiful olive trees cover the vast landscapes in Andalucia. Why not buy your own finca with olive trees?</value>

  <data name="InlandAndaluciaregion" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Andalucía is the region of Spain that attracts most tourism. Its good weather and unique history make it a perfect destination for short or long visits alike. Andalucía is composed of eight provinces:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="InlandAndaluciathesesierras" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>These sierras are a joy to behold, and well worth the trouble of getting out of the car and exploring on foot. Forested with oaks and maples, they are home to wild cats and boar, foxes and hedgehogs - not to mention the Cabrera shrew. Eagles, falcons, vultures and kestrels circle the skies high above; cuckoos, partridges, owls and swifts compete for the lower air space. Butterflies flutter through a pastoral scene of pure delight. It's not without interest underground, either, with some wonderful cave formations, the work of rivers flowing through the limestone fissures.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="InlandAndaluciawithclimate" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With a climate which is typically Andalusian which is hot in summer, mild in spring and autumn, a little chilly in the depths of winter, inland Andalucia, including La Subbética de Córdoba, offers so much to the visitor: authentic Andaluz lifestyle, a rich cultural tapestry, beautiful countryside, attractive towns and villages - and an easy journey to each and every one of Andalucía's great historic cities as well as Malaga's airport, which is only an hour away from most of the towns we cover.</value>

  <data name="LocationMapInlandautonomous" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The autonomous region of Andalucia lies in the the south of Spain, and its coasts are bathed by both the Mediterranean and Atlantic oceans.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LocationMapInlandborders" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It borders Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha in the north, Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea in the east, the Mediterranean and Atlantic ocean in the south, and Portugal in the west. The region's scenery stands out because of its sheer diversity. Some areas are covered in mountains while others are full of plains. There are three distinct geographical structures: the sierra Morena to the north, the Guadalquivir river and Betica depression in the central part of the region, and the Betica mountain ranges in the south.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LocationMapInlandmostnotable" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The two most notable mountainous areas are the sub-Betica range, containing La Sagra massif that reaches an altitude of 2,383 metres and the Penibetica mountain range. The Sierra Nevada is also outstanding and is home to el Mulhacen, the highest mountain peak on the Iberian Peninsula reaching a height of 3,481 metres. Next comes Veleta peak at 3,392 metres. Andalucian rivers that lead into the Mediterranean sea are relatively short and contain small amounts of water. Amongst these are the Almanzora, the Almeria, the Adra, the Guadalfeo, the Guadalhore and the Guadiaro. The rivers that flow into the Atlantic are bigger and have more copious waters. The region's most important river is the Guadalquivir and its tributaries: the Guadalimar, the Guadiana Menor and the Genil. The Guadiana, the Odiel and the Tinto rivers also flow into the Atlantic.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LocationMapInlandvaststrech" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The vast stretch of coast that extends along Andalucia is filled with bays and inlets, some a little more craggy than others as we near the Betica mountain ranges. The most notable geographical quirks that are found along the coast include: the steep rock summit of Farallon, Polacra point, Gata cape, the gulf of Almeria, las Entinas point, Adra bay, Sacratif bay, Malaga bay and Calaburras point. Europa Point forms the Gibraltar headland. This is where the Spanish coast begins stretching from the straits of Gibraltar up to the cape of Trafalgar. Within the straits the most notable parts of the landscape are formed by Algeciras bay as well as by Marroqui (Moroccan) and Tarifa points.</value>
