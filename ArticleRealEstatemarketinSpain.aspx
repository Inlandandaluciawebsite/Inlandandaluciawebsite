       <h1>The Real Estate market in Spain: Making profits out of sand</h1>
       <p>By Ofer Shoshani Â© 2005</p>
       
       <p>The Real estate market in Spain keeps gaining momentum and is of a vital interest among overseas investors. Property prices in the country continue growing at rapid pace due to a sustainable development in many areas of the mainland and the islands.</p>
       <p>Spain's pleasant climate, low cost of living and specific slow pace of life attract more and more real estate investors from many countries of the world and northern European countries in particular. Spain boasts of plenty of magnificent places that encourage tourism, from international playgrounds on the Coast to inland areas such as Granada and Seville. Investing in Spain real estate promises favorable rental income flows with the healthy capital return on top.</p>
       <p>The popular areas among real estate investors are Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Andalucia, Seville, Granada, Malaga and many others. But, the most popular real estate investments are naturally the Coasts. Be they golf courses in Coastas or rural hideaways and whitewashed village houses in inland areas, property market in Spain has shown a sustained growth in prices and such tendency is likely to continue in the future.</p>
       <p>Buying real estate in Spain makes sense for a number of reasons. Spanish constitution guarantees that your home is your private property only, irrespective of citizenship. Then, real estate property prices are growing and are expected to continue growing in the future. Moreover, buying property gives you the right of living in the country for 90 days per half of a year. In addition, the visa may be renewed every year for an unlimited number of times. There are beneficial loan terms in Spain and you can receive property immediately after having paid the first payment.</p>
       <p>However, as attractive as any investment in property may appear, making a profit out of it is a skill (and not a right) which requires experience, and usually, a lot of hard work. Some of the best investments fail for reasons which never could have been anticipated and others fail for reasons which should have been anticipated. In all investment, regardless of how good it may appear initially, there is always a risk. However, good judgment, experience and careful research are usually up to canceling out the majority of this. </p>
